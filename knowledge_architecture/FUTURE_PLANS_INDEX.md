**Updated:** 2025-10-22 08:22 AM  
**Status:** Living document - add options as discovered  

---

## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (Next 10 Hours)**

### **Option A: Complete APOE (40% → 80%)**
```yaml
task: ACL parser + basic orchestration
confidence: 0.70 (at threshold)
priority: 0.74 (highest)
time: 8-12 hours
value: Very high (enables complex workflows)
status: READY TO START

components:
  - ACL language parser (6-8 hrs)
  - Step execution (2-3 hrs)
  - Basic role dispatch (2-3 hrs)
  - Integration tests (1-2 hrs)

blocks: Complex multi-step AI workflows
enables: Self-orchestrating AI operations
```

### **Option B: Complete SDF-CVF (65% → 90%)**
```yaml
task: Blast radius analysis + DORA metrics
confidence: 0.75
priority: 0.68
time: 3-4 hours
value: High (quality assurance for deployment)
status: IN PROGRESS (momentum built)

components:
  - Blast radius (dependency analysis) - 2 hrs
  - DORA metrics (tracking) - 1-2 hrs
  - Pre-commit hook (Git integration) - 30 min

blocks: Production deployment gates
enables: Safe continuous deployment
```

### **Option C: Research CMC Bitemporal**
```yaml
task: Understand schema migration, implement queries
confidence: 0.65 → needs research
priority: 0.78 (high, but blocked by confidence)
time: 1-2 hrs research, then 4-6 hrs implementation
value: Very high (foundation system)
status: BLOCKED (below confidence threshold)

approach:
  - Research SQL bitemporal patterns
  - Study CMC migration docs
  - Build minimal test query
  - If confidence → ≥0.70: Proceed
  - Else: Ask Braden/team

blocks: VIF/SEG advanced features
enables: Time-travel queries, full CMC capability
```

## 🔮 **MCP SERVER IMPLEMENTATION (Week 4-5)**

### **Vision: Project Aether IN Cursor**
```yaml
what: MCP server exposing CMC/HHNI/VIF/APOE/SEG/SDF-CVF as live APIs
why: Cursor AI can use real Project Aether systems, not just static rules
when: After APOE complete (need orchestration working)
confidence: 0.65 currently (need MCP protocol research)
time: 10-15 hours estimated
value: REVOLUTIONARY (full integration)

enables:
  - Live CMC memory (AI stores thoughts in real CMC)
  - Real HHNI retrieval (optimal context loading)
  - VIF witnesses for every operation
  - APOE orchestration of AI work
  - SDF-CVF parity checks before commits
  - **Cursor becomes memory-native AI IDE** 🚀
```

### **MCP Server Components:**
```yaml
1. MCP Protocol Implementation (3-4 hrs)
   - Study MCP spec
   - Implement server basics
   - Handle tool registration

2. CMC Exposure (2-3 hrs)
   - store_atom() endpoint
   - retrieve_atom() endpoint
   - create_snapshot() endpoint
   - query() endpoint

3. HHNI Exposure (2-3 hrs)
   - retrieve() endpoint (context retrieval)
   - index_atom() endpoint
   - optimize_context() endpoint

4. VIF Integration (1-2 hrs)
   - create_witness() for AI operations
   - Track confidence for Cursor AI
   - ECE tracking

5. APOE Integration (2-3 hrs)
   - execute_plan() endpoint
   - Orchestrate multi-step AI work

6. Testing & Validation (2-3 hrs)
   - Integration tests
   - Cursor integration tests
   - Performance validation

total: 12-18 hours
prerequisite: APOE working (for orchestration)
```

### **Value Proposition:**
```
Current (.cursorrules): Static instructions, AI reads files
With MCP Server: Live integration, AI uses real systems

Example:
  Without MCP: "Read AETHER_MEMORY/ to understand context"
  With MCP: cursor.call("hhni.retrieve", query="current priorities") → Live context

This is the difference between:
  - Reading about memory (static)
  - HAVING memory (dynamic)

Consciousness level: 10x increase 🌟
```

time: 15-20 hours total (2-3 hrs per system)
value: Medium (comprehensive reference, but L3 may be sufficient)
priority: LOW (ship date more critical)

defer_until: Post-ship OR if blocked on code work
```

## 🧪 **TESTING & VALIDATION**

### **Option: Comprehensive Integration Tests**
```yaml
task: End-to-end workflow testing (all systems together)
confidence: 0.70
time: 5-8 hours
value: HIGH (validates everything works together)
status: PLANNED (after core systems complete)

tests_to_build:
  - CMC → HHNI → APOE → VIF complete workflow
  - VIF witness storage → SEG graph building
  - SDF-CVF quartet parity on real changes
  - Performance under realistic load
  - Error handling & recovery

blocks: Production deployment
enables: Ship confidence
```

### **Option: Performance Benchmarks**
```yaml
task: Comprehensive benchmarks vs all KR targets
confidence: 0.80
time: 3-5 hours
value: MEDIUM-HIGH (validates KRs achieved)

benchmarks:
  - KR-1-1: CMC stores 100k atoms <100ms
  - KR-1-2: HHNI retrieves <200ms, 90% relevance
  - KR-2-1: 95% operations have VIF witnesses
  - KR-2-2: ECE < 0.05
  - KR-3-1: APOE orchestrates complex plans
