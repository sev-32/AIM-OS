# Level 1: System Overview - A Total System of Memory

**HHNI Level:** SYSTEM (10,000-foot view)  
**Purpose:** Understand AIM-OS in one glance  
**Read Time:** 2 minutes  
**Source:** "A Total System of Memory" (61,739 words, Edition v0.1)

## üìä **100-Word Summary**

AIM-OS transforms AI from unreliable chatbots into trustworthy cognitive systems through five architectural invariants: CMC (memory-native storage with atoms and snapshots), HHNI (hierarchical indexing with physics-guided retrieval), APOE (compiled reasoning with typed plans), VIF (verifiable outputs with uncertainty quantification), and SEG (temporal evidence graphs). Together, these invariants eliminate hallucinations, prevent context loss, enable full auditability, and support atomic evolution of code/docs/tests. The system uses DVNS physics (gravity, elastic, repulse, damping forces) to solve "lost in the middle" and Œ∫-gating to enforce abstention when uncertain. Result: Verifiable path to AGI.

---

## üéØ **The Core Problem**

**Current AI systems fail because:**
- Hallucinations (no grounding, no witnesses)
- Context loss (ephemeral, not memory-native)
- Improvisation (no compiled plans, no budgets)
- Black boxes (no provenance, no replay)
- Drift (code/docs/tests diverge over time)

**Impact:** Can't trust AI for critical tasks, can't audit decisions, can't scale safely.

---

## üèóÔ∏è **The Solution: Five Invariants**

### **1. CMC (Context Memory Core)** - The Foundation
**Problem:** AI forgets everything between sessions  
**Solution:** Structured, queryable, bitemporal memory
- **Atoms:** Typed, tagged, embedded memory units
- **Snapshots:** Content-addressed, immutable bundles
- **Time Travel:** Transaction time (TT) + Valid time (VT)
- **Determinism:** Single-writer, reversible

**Result:** AI that never forgets, always remembers context

---

### **2. HHNI (Hierarchical Hypergraph Neural Index)** - The Intelligence
**Problem:** "Lost in the middle" - can't find relevant context  
**Solution:** Fractal indexing with physics-guided retrieval
- **6 Levels:** System ‚Üí Section ‚Üí Paragraph ‚Üí Sentence ‚Üí Word ‚Üí Subword
- **DVNS Physics:** 4 forces optimize context layout
  - Gravity: Pull related concepts together
  - Elastic: Maintain structural coherence
  - Repulse: Separate contradictions
  - Damping: Stabilize convergence
- **Two-Stage Retrieval:** Coarse KNN ‚Üí Physics refinement
- **RS-Lift:** ‚â•+15% improvement over baseline

**Result:** AI that finds perfect context every time, eliminates "lost in middle"

---

### **3. APOE (AI-Powered Orchestration Engine)** - The Planner
**Problem:** AI improvises and fails unpredictably  
**Solution:** Compiled reasoning into executable plans
- **ACL (AIMOS Chain Language):** Typed, budgeted plans
- **Roles:** Planner, Retriever, Reasoner, Verifier, Builder, Critic, Operator, Witness
- **Gates:** Budget enforcement, quality checks, safety gates
- **DEPP:** Self-rewriting plans via evidence

**Result:** AI that plans before acting, with full audit trails

---

### **4. VIF (Verifiable Intelligence Framework)** - The Trust
**Problem:** Can't trust AI outputs, no way to verify  
**Solution:** Provenance envelope for every output
- **Witness Envelope:** Model, prompt, tools, snapshot, uncertainty
- **Replay:** Deterministic reproduction capability
- **Œ∫-Gating:** Abstain when confidence < threshold
- **ECE:** Expected Calibration Error ‚â§ 0.05
- **Confidence Bands:** A (high), B (medium), C (low/abstain)

**Result:** AI outputs are trustworthy, traceable, replayable

---

### **5. SEG (Shared Evidence Graph)** - The Audit
**Problem:** No way to trace decisions, contradictions undetected  
**Solution:** Temporal knowledge graph with provenance
- **Nodes:** Claims, sources, derivations, decisions
- **Edges:** Supports, contradicts, derives, witnesses
- **Bitemporal:** Query "what was known at time T"
- **Conflict Detection:** Automatic contradiction identification

**Result:** Complete audit trail, contradiction-free knowledge

---

### **6. SDF-CVF (Atomic Evolution Framework)** - The Governance
**Problem:** Code, docs, tests drift out of sync  
**Solution:** Atomic evolution with parity gates
- **Parity Score P:** Measure alignment across code/docs/tests/traces
- **Gates:** Block merges when P < 0.90
- **Quarantine:** Isolate low-quality changes
- **Auto-remediation:** Suggest fixes automatically

**Result:** Code and documentation never drift, system stays coherent
