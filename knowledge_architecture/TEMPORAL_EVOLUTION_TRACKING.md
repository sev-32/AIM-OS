"AI reasoning should be compiled (like code) before execution, not improvised."

### **Insight 4: Quartet or Nothing** (Mar 2025)
"Code, docs, tests, traces must evolve together or the system drifts."

### **Insight 5: Fractal is Universal** (Oct 2025)
"The 5-level detail pyramid works for EVERYTHING, applied recursively."
