## The Problem

Current AI systems are brilliant idiots. They hallucinate facts, forget context between sessions, improvise solutions without planning, provide no way to verify their reasoning, and break when you try to scale them. Large language models have incredible capabilities but fatal flaws: no persistent memory, no verifiable outputs, no way to audit decisions, and no mechanism to prevent code/documentation drift as systems evolve.

## The Solution: Five Architectural Invariants

**AIM-OS solves these fundamental problems through five architectural invariants that work together:**

**CMC (Context Memory Core)** transforms ephemeral context into structured, queryable, reversible memory. Instead of chat history, every interaction becomes typed atoms stored in a bitemporal database. Snapshots create content-addressed, immutable bundles. Single-writer discipline ensures determinism. Result: AI that never forgets and can time-travel through its own memory.

**HHNI (Hierarchical Hypergraph Neural Index)** solves the "lost in the middle" problem through fractal indexing and physics-guided retrieval. Six hierarchical levels (System → Section → Paragraph → Sentence → Word → Subword) enable multi-resolution context access. DVNS (Dynamic Vector Navigation System) uses four physics forces—gravity (attract related), elastic (maintain structure), repulse (separate contradictions), damping (stabilize)—to optimize context layout in embedding space. Two-stage retrieval (coarse KNN → physics refinement) delivers ≥+15% improvement over baseline. Result: Perfect context every time.

**APOE (AI-Powered Orchestration Engine)** compiles reasoning into executable, typed plans using ACL (AIMOS Chain Language). Instead of improvised chains, APOE orchestrates eight specialized roles (planner, retriever, reasoner, verifier, builder, critic, operator, witness) with explicit budgets (tokens, time, tools) and safety gates. DEPP (Dynamic Emergent Prompt Pipeline) enables self-rewriting plans that improve via evidence. Result: Verifiable execution with full audit trails.

**VIF (Verifiable Intelligence Framework)** makes every output trustworthy through provenance envelopes containing model ID, weights hash, prompts, data snapshots, tools used, and uncertainty quantification. κ-gating enforces behavioral abstention when confidence falls below threshold. ECE (Expected Calibration Error) tracking ensures AI confidence matches actual accuracy (target: ≤0.05). Confidence bands (A/B/C) provide transparency. Deterministic replay enables bit-identical reproduction of any operation. Result: Trustworthy, auditable AI outputs.

**SEG (Shared Evidence Graph)** treats evidence as a time-sliced knowledge graph, not documents. Nodes represent claims, sources, and derivations. Edges represent relationships (supports, contradicts, derives, witnesses). Bitemporal storage enables queries like "what was known about X at time T?" Contradiction detection is automatic. Export packs provide complete audit trails. Result: Full provenance with conflict awareness.

**SDF-CVF (Atomic Evolution Framework)** ensures code, documentation, tests, and traces evolve together through parity gates. Parity score P measures alignment across the quartet—only changes with P ≥ 0.90 can merge. Low-parity changes go to quarantine with auto-remediation suggestions. Blast radius calculation prevents cascading failures. Result: System that never drifts, stays perpetually coherent.

## Current Status

As of October 21, 2025: HHNI 95% complete (77 tests passing), CMC 75% complete (operational), APOE 55% complete (tested with 28 agents), VIF 30% complete (Week 4 priority), SEG 35% complete (Week 5), SDF-CVF 50% complete (Week 5). Overall system: 65-70% complete. Notable: DVNS physics actually works—"lost in middle" problem solved in production code.

## The Vision

These six invariants create a verifiable path to AGI by providing the cognitive substrate missing from current AI: perfect memory, intelligent retrieval, compiled reasoning, quantified trust, temporal evidence, and atomic evolution. Together, they transform AI from unreliable tools into trustworthy cognitive partners.
