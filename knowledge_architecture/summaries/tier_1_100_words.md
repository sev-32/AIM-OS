AIM-OS transforms AI from unreliable chatbots into trustworthy cognitive systems. Five architectural invariants solve fundamental problems: **CMC** (memory-native storage eliminates context loss), **HHNI** (physics-guided retrieval solves "lost in the middle"), **APOE** (compiled plans replace improvisation), **VIF** (uncertainty quantification enables trust), and **SEG** (temporal evidence graphs provide auditability). DVNS physics uses four forces—gravity, elastic, repulse, damping—to optimize context layout. κ-gating enforces abstention when uncertain. SDF-CVF ensures code/docs/tests evolve atomically. Result: Verifiable, auditable, self-improving AI substrate—a proven path to AGI.
