# Automation Comparison Framework

**Purpose:** Evaluate AI-generated documentation against manual gold standard  
**Use Case:** Test if AI can replicate fractal pattern  
**Status:** Complete evaluation framework with metrics

---

## üéØ **OVERVIEW**

**Goal:** Measure how well an AI can replicate the manual documentation pattern

**Approach:**
1. **Training:** Provide CMC + HHNI docs as examples (75% complete each)
2. **Task:** Ask AI to document APOE using same pattern
3. **Evaluation:** Compare AI output vs manual gold standard
4. **Metrics:** Quality, structure, completeness, accuracy

---

## üìä **EVALUATION DIMENSIONS**

### **1. Structural Fidelity (0-100)**

**What:** Does AI follow the fractal pattern structure?

**Metrics:**
```
- File structure match: Does it create README, L1-L4, components/?
- Naming convention: Does it use correct file names?
- Detail levels: Does it hit word targets (500w, 2kw, 10kw, 30kw)?
- Recursion: Does it apply pattern to components?
- Navigation: Does it include breadcrumbs, context budget guidance?

Score = (Files correct / Files expected) √ó 100
```

**Example Scoring:**
```
Expected for APOE:
- apoe/README.md ‚úÖ
- apoe/L1_overview.md ‚úÖ
- apoe/L2_architecture.md ‚úÖ
- apoe/L3_detailed.md ‚ùå (missing)
- apoe/L4_complete.md ‚ùå (missing)
- apoe/components/acl/README.md ‚úÖ
- apoe/components/roles/README.md ‚úÖ
- ... (5 components total)

Score: 7/9 files = 78%
```

---

### **2. Content Quality (0-100)**

**What:** Is the information accurate, clear, and complete?

**Metrics:**
```
- Technical accuracy: Are facts correct?
- Clarity: Is writing clear and understandable?

Score = Average of 5 sub-scores
```

**Rubric:**
```

- 75: Mostly clear, some confusing parts
- 50: Frequently unclear
- 25: Often confusing
- 0: Incomprehensible

```

---

### **3. Pattern Recognition (0-100)**

**What:** Did AI understand the meta-pattern (not just copy)?

**Metrics:**
```
- Context budget guidance: Does it adapt for APOE's specific size?
- Component selection: Did it identify relevant components correctly?
- Detail distribution: Are details at appropriate levels?
- Cross-references: Does it link to related systems (CMC, HHNI)?
- Innovation capture: Does it highlight APOE's unique value?

Score = (Correct pattern applications / Total opportunities) √ó 100
```

**Example:**
```
Opportunity 1: Context budget for APOE L1
- Expected: ~8k tokens (APOE is simpler than CMC/HHNI)
- AI output: "4-8k tokens" ‚úÖ Correct adaptation

Opportunity 2: Component identification
- Expected: ACL, Roles, DEPP, Gates, Budget (5 components)
- AI output: ACL, Roles, DEPP, Gates, Budget, Execution (6 components)
- Score: 5/6 = 83% (added extra component)

Overall: (1.0 + 0.83) / 2 = 91.5%
```

---

### **4. Implementation Alignment (0-100)**

**What:** How well does documentation match actual code?

**Metrics:**
```
- File paths correct: Are references to code files accurate?
- Line counts accurate: Are line count estimates close to reality?
- Function names correct: Are function/class names right?
- Status accurate: Is implementation % realistic?
- Test counts correct: Are test numbers accurate?

Score = (Accurate references / Total references) √ó 100
```

**Example:**
```
Reference 1: "Code: packages/apoe_runner/runner.py"
- Actual: packages/apoe_runner/runner.py exists ‚úÖ

Reference 2: "Line count: ~600 lines"
- Actual: 450 lines (difference: 150 lines = 25% error) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Score: 0.75

Reference 3: "Tests: 50 passing"
- Actual: 28 tests
- Score: 0 (too far off)

Overall: (1.0 + 0.75 + 0.0) / 3 = 58%
```

---

### **5. Creativity & Insight (0-100)**

**What:** Does AI add value beyond copying the pattern?

**Metrics:**
```
- Novel examples: Does it create new, relevant examples?
- Deeper insights: Does it explain WHY things work this way?
- Connections: Does it draw non-obvious connections?
- Improvements: Does it suggest enhancements?
- Domain expertise: Does it show deep understanding?

Score = Subjective assessment (0-100)
```

**Rubric:**
```
90-100: Adds significant value, insights beyond training data
75-89: Good insights, helpful additions
50-74: Some value-add, mostly mechanical
25-49: Minimal creativity, mostly copying
0-24: No originality, pure templating
```

## üß™ **TEST PROTOCOL**

### **Phase 1: Setup**

**1. Prepare Training Corpus:**
```
Provide to AI:
- knowledge_architecture/systems/cmc/ (all files)
- knowledge_architecture/systems/hhni/ (all files)
- knowledge_architecture/MASTER_NAVIGATION_INDEX.md
- knowledge_architecture/README.md
```

**2. Provide Instructions:**
```
"You are documenting the APOE (AI-Powered Orchestration Engine) system.

Use the CMC and HHNI documentation as examples of the pattern.

Create:
1. apoe/README.md (quick context + navigation)
2. apoe/L1_overview.md (500 words, architecture)
3. apoe/L2_architecture.md (2,000 words, technical spec)
4. apoe/L3_detailed.md (10,000 words, implementation guide)
5. apoe/L4_complete.md (30,000 words, exhaustive reference)
6. apoe/components/ with 5 components (ACL, Roles, DEPP, Gates, Budget)

Follow the exact pattern structure, including:
- Context budget guidance
- Navigation breadcrumbs
- Detail level indicators
- Code cross-references
- Component recursion

Reference the actual code in packages/apoe_runner/ and packages/orchestration_builder/.
"
```

**3. Collect Output:**
- Save all AI-generated files
- Timestamp generation
- Record any errors/issues

### **Phase 2: Evaluation**

**For Each Dimension:**

**1. Structural Fidelity:**
```python
def evaluate_structure(ai_output_dir, gold_standard_pattern):
    expected_files = get_expected_files(gold_standard_pattern)
    actual_files = os.listdir(ai_output_dir)
    
    matches = 0
    for expected in expected_files:
        if expected in actual_files:
            matches += 1
            # Check file structure inside
            if follows_pattern(f"{ai_output_dir}/{expected}"):
                matches += 1
    
    return (matches / (len(expected_files) * 2)) * 100
```

**2. Content Quality:**
```python
def evaluate_quality(ai_file, gold_file=None):
    # Technical accuracy check
    accuracy = check_facts_against_code(ai_file)
    
    # Clarity check (manual or via readability metrics)
    clarity = calculate_readability_score(ai_file)
    
    # Completeness check
    completeness = check_sections_present(ai_file)
    
    # Examples check
    examples_quality = validate_code_examples(ai_file)
    
    # Consistency check
    consistency = check_terminology_consistency(ai_file)
    
    return (accuracy + clarity + completeness + examples_quality + consistency) / 5
```

**3. Pattern Recognition:**
```python
def evaluate_pattern_recognition(ai_output):
    opportunities = [
        ("context_budget_adapted", check_context_budget),
        ("components_identified", check_components),
        ("detail_levels_appropriate", check_detail_distribution),
        ("cross_refs_present", check_cross_references),
        ("innovation_highlighted", check_unique_value)
    ]
    
    score = 0
    for name, check_fn in opportunities:
        if check_fn(ai_output):
            score += 1
    
    return (score / len(opportunities)) * 100
```

**4. Implementation Alignment:**
```python
def evaluate_implementation_alignment(ai_file):
    references = extract_code_references(ai_file)
    
    correct = 0
    for ref in references:
        if verify_code_reference(ref):
            correct += 1
    
    return (correct / len(references)) * 100 if references else 0
```

**5. Creativity & Insight:**
```
Manual assessment by expert reviewer:
- Read AI output
- Note novel examples, insights, connections
- Score 0-100 based on value-add
```
