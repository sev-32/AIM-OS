# o3-pro Review (via Cursor - $10 lesson learned)

**Note:** This review was obtained by switching Cursor's model to o3-pro directly, which cost $10 for minimal output. This approach is NOT recommended. Future AI collaboration should happen externally with Aether coordinating.

---

**What o3-pro provided:**

## Key Valid Points:

1. **Architecture is sound** - Layered stack makes sense, no circular dependencies
2. **Claims need qualification** - "Zero hallucinations", "40-75% improvement" need evidence
3. **CMC/SEG incomplete** - Correctly identified that bitemporal queries and SEG are not yet implemented
4. **Length concern** - 7,500 words may be too long, suggested 300-word executive summary
5. **Confidence: 7/10** - Reasonable assessment

## Useful Recommendations:

1. Add benchmark appendix for performance claims
2. Explicitly state implementation status for each system
3. Provide 300-word executive abstract
4. Clarify "production-ready" definition
5. Add Docker quick-start
6. Simplify physics metaphor language

## Questions Raised:

1. What constitutes "hallucination" in testing?
2. When will CMC bitemporal be complete?
3. What will back SEG at scale?
4. CAS: protocol vs implementation?
5. License for enterprise?

**Cost:** ~$10 for 4 prompts
**Value:** Some valid points, but not worth the cost
**Lesson:** Don't use expensive models in Cursor directly
**Better approach:** Aether coordinates externally

---

**What we learned:**
- o3-pro CAN provide valuable architectural review
- But going through Cursor is too expensive
- Better: Copy prompt to o3-pro in its native interface
- Aether (Claude in Cursor) synthesizes all feedback

**Proceeding with standard approach from here.**
