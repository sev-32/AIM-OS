# GPT‑5 README V2 Implementation Plan

Prepared by: GPT‑5 High (Max Mode)
Date: 2025-10-22
Target file: knowledge_architecture/README_DEVELOPMENT/README_DRAFT_V1.md

---

## Priority 1 — Critical (Must‑fix before publication) — ~2 hours

1) Update test totals & per‑system counts
- Replace all instances of 516 → 556
- Adjust breakdown:
  - HHNI: 77 → 78
  - APOE: 180 → 179
  - Integration: 35 → 36
  - Add: CMC ≈ 20; Other ≈ 19

2) Reframe unverifiable phrasing
- Executive summary & Stability sections:
  - “Zero hallucinations” → “Zero test failures or factual errors detected during 10+ hours of autonomous development; 556 tests passing.”

3) Clarify CMC & CAS implementation status
- CMC (Core Systems + Performance): Add “time‑travel query API completing November 2025; structure implemented.”
- CAS (Core Systems): “Operational as documented protocols; code package planned for version 2.0.”

4) Qualify performance claims with citations
- HHNI 75% improvement → add “(see benchmarks/hhni_performance.py; measured on i7 8‑core, 16GB RAM).”
- Redundancy reduction → “(via LSH deduplication).”
- APOE 2–3× speedup → “(on multi‑core systems for independent steps).”

5) License & Python version
- License: add “Apache 2.0 or MIT to be finalized by 2025‑11‑15.”
- Python: change “Python ≥3.13” → “Python ≥3.11 (3.13 recommended).”

6) Verify Quick Start example
- Run the example; if `from vif import WitnessStore` fails, correct to available public API (e.g., `from vif.cmc_integration import VIFStore as WitnessStore`) or update import path per current exports.

## Priority 2 — Important (Should‑do for world‑class quality) — ~2 hours

7) Add 300‑word executive abstract at top
- Concise problem/solution/status snapshot
- For skimmability and enterprise readers

8) Add Docker quick‑start
- Pull/run image and Compose example
- Include “pytest packages/ -v” step in container

9) Add troubleshooting and environment notes
- Python version check; dependency checks; model download size (~400MB); common fixes

10) GPU & Network requirements
- Optional CUDA for embeddings (≈10× faster); CPU‑only fine
- Initial model download bandwidth requirements; optional external vector DBs

11) Risk & mitigation table; adjust ship confidence to 90%
- CMC bitemporal; SEG backend; integration risk very low

12) Convert doc references to clickable links
- Use GitHub‑relative paths for systems and key docs

13) Compress “Key Innovations” by ~25%
- Remove overlap with Core Systems; add status badges (✅ 🔄 📋)

14) Contributing updates
- Add CLA requirement (CLA Assistant)
- Soften “zero tolerance” → “regressions block merge”
- Add issue triage guidelines

---

## Priority 3 — Optional (Polish) — 3–5 hours

15) Replace ASCII architecture diagram with SVG
16) Add comparison table (Aether vs LangChain/LlamaIndex/SK)
17) Add FAQ (who it’s for, learning curve, performance, contribution)
18) Add shields (build, tests, coverage, Python, license, status)
19) Move RTFT to THEORY.md with a brief summary and link in README
