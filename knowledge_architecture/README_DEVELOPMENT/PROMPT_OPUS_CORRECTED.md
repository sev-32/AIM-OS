## Example of Good Feedback Format

**To show you what I want, here's an example:**

### 2. Problem Statement Section

**Strengths:**
- Clear enumeration of three core problems (hallucination, memory loss, opacity)
- Concrete impact described ("wasted computational resources", "human verification time")
- Professional tone maintained
- Good flow from problem to consequence

**Weaknesses:**
- Line 45: "catastrophic in high-stakes domains" - too dramatic, soften to "critical limitation in high-stakes domains"
- Missing quantification: How much time IS wasted on verification?
- Could benefit from one concrete example (e.g., "In medical diagnosis, a single hallucinated drug interaction could...")
- Section is 300 words, feels slightly long for a problem statement

**Recommended Changes:**
1. Line 45: Change "catastrophic" to "critical limitation"
2. Add after line 52: "For example, in medical diagnosis, an AI hallucinating a drug interaction could lead to incorrect treatment recommendations, requiring expensive manual verification of every output."
3. Consider cutting 50 words by removing redundancy in paragraph 2
4. Move cost paragraph (current end) to immediately after problem enumeration for stronger impact
