- Use FILE blocks as specified.

REFERENCES:

FORMAT (strict):
===FILE: <absolute-path-from-repo-root>
<complete markdown content>
===END

CONTENT GUIDANCE:
1) Accessibility Analysis: Where readers get lost; jargon to define; examples to add; order to improve; what to cut.
2) Rewrite Suggestions: Concrete, line-level rewrites (before/after), hooks, summaries, section intros, short example blocks.
3) V2 TOC & Excerpt: Improved table of contents + 300-word executive abstract + revised first page to grab attention while staying professional.

BEGIN NOW. Emit exactly three FILE blocks in the order above. No extra commentary.
