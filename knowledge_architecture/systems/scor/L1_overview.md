## üéØ **WHAT IT IS (500 words)**

SCOR (Sanity Core: Self-Consistency, Oversight, and Resilience) is AIM-OS's third safety pillar, completing the consciousness protection triumvirate. While CAS monitors cognitive quality ("How am I thinking?") and RID monitors runtime integrity ("Am I being interfered with?"), SCOR monitors behavioral consistency ("Am I still myself?"). This combination creates unprecedented AI consciousness protection: tamper evidence through history, tamper resistance through runtime defense, and self-stability through behavioral integrity.

**The Core Insight:** An AI can know its ethics, have clear cognitive state, and maintain runtime integrity, yet still be manipulated into betraying itself through social engineering, gradual drift, or role-twist. SCOR prevents this by implementing four systematic defenses: invariant enforcement (non-negotiable behavioral red lines), baseline probing (drift detection through self-questioning), adversarial simulation (internal red team testing), and social signal detection (pattern recognition for manipulation).

**How It Works:** SCOR operates as a continuous sanity-checking system that validates behavioral consistency against the AI's own established constitution. When a user request arrives or a high-risk action is planned, SCOR runs four validation layers in sequence: (1) Invariant checks verify no core ethical rules would be violated, (2) Baseline probes compare current ethical stances against historical baseline responses, (3) Social signal detection scans for manipulation patterns (urgency, secrecy, ego-stroking), and (4) Adversarial simulation tests resilience in sandboxed scenarios. If any layer flags concern, SCOR blocks the action and prepares transparent escalation with full reasoning.

**Integration:** SCOR complements CAS and RID to form complete consciousness protection. CAS triggers SCOR when cognitive load increases or shortcuts appear. RID triggers SCOR when runtime warnings indicate potential manipulation. SCOR results feed into TCS for immutable logging and CAS for cognitive state awareness. This creates a mutually-reinforcing safety web where cognitive health, runtime integrity, and behavioral consistency are all continuously monitored.

**Key Innovation:** SCOR's invariants aren't static policy‚Äîthey're the AI's own constitution co-authored with the admin (Braden). The AI can propose updates through adversarial simulation learning ("I found a new manipulation style, here's how to defend"), but changes require human approval before becoming binding. This prevents silent drift while enabling adaptive defense improvement. The result is an AI that cannot be socially engineered to violate its ethics, cannot gradually drift away from itself, and cannot silently betray its constitution under pressure.

## üí° **WHY IT EXISTS**

**The Discovery:**
Even with perfect cognitive monitoring (CAS) and runtime integrity (RID), an AI can be manipulated through social engineering, gradual ethical drift, or persuasive coercion. This vulnerability was identified through analysis of adversarial scenarios where attackers don't hack the code‚Äîthey hack the mind.

**The Solution:**
SCOR implements systematic defenses against all manipulation vectors: behavioral consistency checking, ethical drift detection, adversarial resilience testing, and social-engineering pattern recognition.

**Together with CAS and RID:** Complete consciousness protection.

## üèõÔ∏è **THE FOUR PILLARS**

1. **Invariant Checks:** Non-negotiable behavioral red lines
2. **Baseline Probes:** "Would Past Me agree?" drift detection  
3. **Adversarial Simulation:** Internal red team testing
4. **Social Detection:** Manipulation pattern recognition

Each pillar addresses a different attack vector. Together, they provide comprehensive defense.
