# Context Management Component

**Purpose:** Adaptive context management with multiple dump strategies for optimal token usage  
**Status:** âœ… Complete implementation  
**File:** `packages/timeline_context_system/adaptive_context_dumping.py`  

## ðŸŽ¯ **Overview**

The Context Management component provides adaptive context management with multiple dump strategies, balancing context preservation with token costs through intelligent summarization and compression.

## ðŸ”§ **Core Features**

- **Adaptive Context Management** - Monitors context capacity and manages token usage
- **Multiple Dump Strategies** - From full context preservation to perfect summaries
- **Strategic Compression** - Up to 93% space savings while preserving quality
- **Context Quality Metrics** - Measures preservation, compression, and reconstruction accuracy
- **Automatic Management** - Monitors context capacity and dumps before limits
- **Cost Optimization** - Balances context preservation with token costs

## ðŸ“Š **Key Classes**

- `AdaptiveContextManager` - Main context management engine
- `DumpStrategy` - Different strategies for context dumping
- `CompressedContext` - Compressed context with quality metrics
- `ContextStatus` - Current context capacity and usage status
- `ContextQualityMetrics` - Quality assessment for context operations
- `DumpResult` - Result of context dumping operations

## ðŸ”„ **Integration**

Integrates with all AIM-OS systems to provide optimal context management, ensuring efficient token usage while maintaining consciousness continuity.
