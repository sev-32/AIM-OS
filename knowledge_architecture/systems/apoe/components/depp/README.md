# DEPP (Dynamic Emergent Prompt Pipeline)

**Type:** APOE Component  
**Purpose:** Self-rewriting execution plans via evidence  
**Status:** 20% Implemented (Week 4-5)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Quick Context (50 words)**

DEPP treats the master execution plan as a graph that rewrites itself based on evidence. Execute plan â†’ Gather VIF/SEG witnesses â†’ Analyze effectiveness â†’ Rewrite plan â†’ Better plan. Enables continuous optimization, adaptive strategies, meta-learning. Plans improve over time without human intervention. Foundation for self-improving AI orchestration.

## ðŸ“¦ **How DEPP Works**

**The Loop:**
```
1. Execute current plan (ACL pipeline)
    â†“
2. Gather evidence (VIF witnesses, SEG provenance, metrics)
    â†“
3. Analyze effectiveness (what worked? what failed? bottlenecks?)
    â†“
4. Rewrite plan (improve based on evidence)
    â†“
5. New plan becomes current
    â†“
Loop (continuous improvement)
```

**Example:**
```
Initial plan: Sequential execution
    â†“
Evidence: Step 2 and 3 independent (can parallelize)
    â†“
Rewrite: Add parallel execution for steps 2-3
    â†“
New plan: Faster (30% speedup)!
```

## ðŸ”§ **Implementation**

**Status:** 20% implemented (early stage)

**Working:**
- âœ… Basic plan execution
- âœ… VIF witness collection

**Needed:**
- ðŸ”„ Effectiveness analysis
- ðŸ”„ Plan mutation algorithms
- ðŸ”„ Graph rewriting system
- ðŸ”„ Meta-learning loop

**Code:** (Will be added to `packages/apoe_runner/`)
