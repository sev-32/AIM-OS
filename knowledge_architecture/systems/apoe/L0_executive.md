## ðŸŽ¯ **What APOE Is**

**AI-Powered Orchestration Engine** - Compiles reasoning into executable plans using declarative ACL (Agent Coordination Language). Think "AI's project manager" - takes high-level goals and creates detailed execution plans with roles, budgets, and quality gates.

## ðŸ”§ **Core Capabilities**

- **ACL Language** - Declarative language for specifying execution plans
- **8 Execution Roles** - Specialized agents for different tasks (research, code, test, etc.)
- **Budget Management** - Token/time/resource allocation with optimization
- **Quality Gates** - Confidence thresholds and validation checkpoints

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Innovation**

Declarative planning that separates intent from implementation. Specify what to do, not how to do it.

## ðŸ“Š **Status**

âœ… Production-ready with 90% completion. ACL parser and role dispatch implemented, 139 tests passing.
