## üéØ **Architecture Overview**

The System Integration Protocols architecture is built on a modular, extensible framework that provides seamless integration between all AIM-OS systems. The architecture ensures consistent communication, data flow, and operational coordination while maintaining system reliability, performance, and security.

## üèóÔ∏è **System Architecture**

### **Core Components**

#### **Integration Manager**
The central component that manages all system integrations, providing a unified interface for system coordination, health monitoring, and error handling. It orchestrates communication between systems and ensures consistent behavior.

#### **System Registry**
Maintains a registry of all AIM-OS systems, their capabilities, interfaces, and current status. It provides discovery services and manages system dependencies and relationships.

#### **Communication Coordinator**
Coordinates communication between systems, ensuring that messages are delivered reliably and efficiently. It implements various communication patterns including synchronous, asynchronous, and event-driven communication.

#### **Health Monitor**
Continuously monitors the health of all systems, detecting issues, performance degradation, or disconnections. It provides real-time health status and generates alerts for critical issues.

#### **Error Handler**
Implements comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms. It detects errors, implements recovery procedures, and restores normal system operation.

#### **Performance Optimizer**
Optimizes system performance through coordinated resource management, load balancing, and performance tuning. It ensures optimal resource utilization across all systems.

### **Architecture Layers**

#### **Presentation Layer**
Provides the external interface for system integration, including REST APIs, GraphQL endpoints, and SDK interfaces for external system integration.

#### **Application Layer**
Implements the core business logic for system integration, including coordination logic, health monitoring, and error handling.

#### **Service Layer**
Provides services for system communication, health monitoring, error handling, and performance optimization. It implements the core functionality for system integration.

#### **Data Layer**
Manages data storage for system configuration, health status, performance metrics, and integration logs. It includes support for multiple database backends.

#### **Integration Layer**
Handles integration with external systems and other AIM-OS systems. It implements adapters for different systems and communication protocols.
