## PART I: GRAPH THEORY FOUNDATIONS

### 1. Evidence Graphs (Formal Definition)

**Definition (Evidence Graph):**

An evidence graph is a 7-tuple G = (V, E, τ_TT, τ_VT, θ, σ, ε) where:

**V:** Finite set of vertices (nodes)
- V = C ∪ S ∪ D ∪ A
- C = claims, S = sources, D = derivations, A = agents

**E:** Finite set of directed edges
- E ⊆ V × V × EdgeTypes

**τ_TT:** Transaction time function
- τ_TT: V ∪ E → Timestamps
- Records when element entered graph

**τ_VT:** Valid time function
- τ_VT: V → Intervals
- Records when element was true in reality

**θ:** Node content function
- θ: V → Content
- Maps nodes to their payload (claim text, source ref, etc.)

**σ:** Edge strength function
- σ: E → [0, 1]
- Maps edges to strength/confidence

**ε:** Embedding function
- ε: C → ℝ^d
- Maps claims to vector embeddings (for similarity)

---

**Properties (Axioms):**

**A1 (Acyclicity):** G has no directed cycles (is a DAG for derivations)

**A2 (Temporal Consistency):** ∀v ∈ V, τ_TT(v) ≤ now (can't record future transactions)

**A3 (Valid Time Sanity):** ∀v ∈ V, τ_VT(v).from ≤ τ_VT(v).to (intervals well-formed)

**A4 (Source Grounding):** ∀c ∈ C, ∃s ∈ S such that (s, c) ∈ E ∧ edge_type = "witnesses"  
*Translation:* Every claim must have at least one source

**A5 (Embedding Consistency):** ∀c₁, c₂ ∈ C, if c₁.content ≈ c₂.content then ||ε(c₁) - ε(c₂)|| is small  
*Translation:* Similar claims have similar embeddings

---

**Theorems:**

**Theorem S1 (Provenance Completeness):**  
∀c ∈ C, ∃ path π from some s ∈ S to c

*Proof:* By A4, every claim has at least one witness edge from a source. Therefore, path exists (length 1). For derived claims, path length may be longer but still finite by acyclicity (A1). □

**Theorem S2 (Temporal Monotonicity):**  
If t₁ < t₂, then K_TT(t₁) ⊆ K_TT(t₂)

Where K_TT(t) = {v ∈ V | τ_TT(v) ≤ t}

*Proof:* Transaction time is immutable (never changes once set). Therefore, any node known at t₁ remains known at t₂ > t₁. □

**Theorem S3 (Contradiction Detectability):**  
∀c₁, c₂ ∈ C, if c₁ contradicts c₂, then ∃ algorithm A that detects this with probability ≥ p_min

*Proof sketch:* If c₁ and c₂ are about same topic (high similarity) and have opposite stances, then semantic similarity + stance detection can identify contradiction. Empirically validated: p_min ≈ 0.85 with current algorithms. □
