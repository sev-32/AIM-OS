# Failure Mode Analysis Component

**Parent System:** Cognitive Analysis System (CAS)  
**Purpose:** Recognize four specific cognitive error patterns  
**Status:** Designed, ready for implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ **QUICK SUMMARY (100 words)**

Failure Mode Analysis detects four specific cognitive error patterns: (1) Categorization Error - task classified wrong leading to wrong protocols, (2) Activation Gap - required principles not "hot" in attention, (3) Procedure Gap - have knowledge but no step-by-step how-to, (4) Self vs System Blind Spot - apply rigor to system but not own work. Each mode has distinct symptoms, detection logic, confidence scores, and remediation protocols. Enables systematic error prevention through pattern recognition. Discovered through actual cognitive failure (bitemporal violation). Validated approach: catch errors before they cause quality degradation.

## ðŸ”§ **THE FOUR FAILURE MODES**

### **Mode 1: Categorization Error**
```yaml
Symptom: Task classified wrong â†’ wrong protocols activated
Example: "Update priorities" as "documentation" not "memory modification"
Detection: Rule-based comparison (perceived vs actual)
Prevention: Explicit task classification before starting
Confidence: 0.95 (rule-based)
```

### **Mode 2: Activation Gap**
```yaml
Symptom: Principle exists but not "hot" in attention
Example: Knew CMC bitemporal, but wasn't thinking about it
Detection: Required protocols vs activation levels
Prevention: Persistent reminders in .cursorrules
Confidence: 0.90
```

### **Mode 3: Procedure Gap**
```yaml
Symptom: Have knowledge (declarative) but no how-to (procedural)
Example: "Bitemporal important" but no versioning checklist
Detection: Task type vs procedure availability
Prevention: Convert principles into checklists
Confidence: 0.85
```

### **Mode 4: Self vs System Blind Spot**
```yaml
Symptom: Apply rigor to "system" but not to "self"
Example: VIF for code, but not for own memory
Detection: Self-work + formality mismatch
Prevention: No exceptions - self gets same rigor
Confidence: 0.80
```

## ðŸ“Š **KEY DATA STRUCTURES**

### **FailureMode**
```python
@dataclass
class FailureMode:
    mode_type: FailureModeType  # CATEGORIZATION | ACTIVATION | PROCEDURE | BLIND_SPOT
    confidence: float
    symptoms: List[str]
    prevention_protocol: str
    immediate_action: str
    learning: str
```

### **FailureModeDetector**
```python
class FailureModeDetector:
    def detect_all(...) -> List[FailureMode]
    def detect_categorization_error(...) -> Optional[FailureMode]
    def detect_activation_gap(...) -> Optional[FailureMode]
    def detect_procedure_gap(...) -> Optional[FailureMode]
    def detect_blind_spot(...) -> Optional[FailureMode]
```

## ðŸ§ª **TESTING**

```bash
pytest packages/cas/tests/test_failure_modes.py -v
```

**Key tests:**
- Categorization error detection
- Activation gap detection
- Procedure gap detection
- Blind spot detection

## ðŸŽ¯ **USAGE EXAMPLE**

```python
from cas.failure_modes import FailureModeDetector

detector = FailureModeDetector()
failures = detector.detect_all(task, activation, attention)

for failure in failures:
    print(f"ðŸš¨ {failure.mode_type.value}: {failure.immediate_action}")
    # Apply prevention protocol
```

**Status:** Ready for implementation  
**Priority:** Critical (core quality assurance)  
**Estimated effort:** 3-4 hours
