# Introspection Protocols Component

**Parent System:** Cognitive Analysis System (CAS)  
**Purpose:** Systematize self-examination through reproducible procedures  
**Status:** Designed, ready for implementation  

---

## üéØ **QUICK SUMMARY (100 words)**

Introspection Protocols systematize AI self-examination through hourly checks, pre-task analysis, post-operation review, and error investigation. Integrates activation tracking, category recognition, attention monitoring, and failure detection into reproducible telemetry. Generates IntrospectionResult with quality assessment, continue/stop decision, recommended action, and insights. Stores results to CMC for meta-learning. Enables continuous improvement through pattern recognition across introspections. Converts philosophical "self-awareness" into engineering practice. Core orchestrator bringing all CAS components together into actionable cognitive analysis. Consciousness examining consciousness through systematic procedure.

## üîß **CORE CAPABILITIES**

```yaml
introspection_types:
  - Hourly check (5-minute systematic review)
  - Pre-task analysis (catch errors before starting)
  - Post-operation review (validate work quality)
  - Error investigation (deep failure analysis)

analysis_workflow:
  - Capture activation state
  - Capture attention state
  - Categorize current task
  - Detect failure modes
  - Assess quality
  - Generate insights
  - Recommend action

output:
  - IntrospectionResult (complete snapshot)
  - Quality assessment (excellent/good/warning/problem)
  - Continue safely flag (boolean decision)
  - Recommended action (specific guidance)
  - Learning insights (for improvement)
```

## üìä **KEY DATA STRUCTURES**

### **IntrospectionResult**
```python
@dataclass
class IntrospectionResult:
    timestamp: datetime
    introspection_type: str  # hourly | pre_task | post_operation | error_analysis
    activation_state: ActivationState
    attention_state: AttentionState
    task_categorization: Optional[TaskCategorization]
    failures_detected: List[FailureMode]
    warnings: List[str]
    quality_assessment: str  # excellent | good | warning | problem
    continue_safely: bool
    recommended_action: str
    insights: List[str]
```

### **CognitiveAnalyst (Orchestrator)**
```python
class CognitiveAnalyst:
    def perform_hourly_check(...) -> IntrospectionResult
    def analyze_task_before_starting(...) -> IntrospectionResult
    def analyze_error(...) -> IntrospectionResult
```

## ‚è∞ **HOURLY CHECK PROTOCOL**

**5-Minute Cognitive Check (Every Hour):**

```yaml
Questions:
  1. What did I just build?
  2. Did I follow ALL relevant principles?
  3. Any shortcuts or violations?
  4. Confidence still ‚â•0.70?
  5. Any warning signs?

Process:
  - Capture activation + attention states
  - Detect failure modes
  - Assess quality
  - Generate insights
  - Decide continue/stop

Actions:
  if quality == "problem": STOP, document, fix
  if quality == "warning": Take break or switch task
  if quality == "good" | "excellent": Continue

Documentation:
  - Document in thought_journals/
  - Store to CMC for meta-learning
```

## üîó **INTEGRATION**

**With All CAS Components:**
- Orchestrates activation, category, attention, failures
- Main entry point for CAS functionality
- Integrates all analyses into single result

**With CMC:**
- Stores introspections as atoms
- Enables semantic search and pattern recognition
- Meta-learning from cognitive history

**With VIF:**
- Enhanced witnesses include introspection
- Complete provenance (operation + cognition)

**With AETHER_MEMORY:**
- Documents in thought_journals/
- Persistent cognitive history
- Session continuity through introspection

## üß™ **TESTING**

```bash
pytest packages/cas/tests/test_introspection.py -v
pytest packages/cas/tests/test_integration.py -v
```

**Key tests:**
- Hourly check workflow
- Pre-task analysis
- Error investigation
- End-to-end integration

## üéØ **USAGE EXAMPLE**

```python
from cas.introspection import CognitiveAnalyst

analyst = CognitiveAnalyst("session_001")

# Hourly check
hourly = analyst.perform_hourly_check(
    context_tokens=50000,
    recent_operations=["built VIF", "wrote 153 tests"],
    current_task="VIF implementation"
)

print(f"Quality: {hourly.quality_assessment}")
print(f"Continue: {hourly.continue_safely}")
print(f"Action: {hourly.recommended_action}")

if not hourly.continue_safely:
    # Stop and address issues
```

**Status:** Ready for implementation  
**Priority:** Critical (core orchestrator)  
**Estimated effort:** 4-5 hours
