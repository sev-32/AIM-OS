### **Troubleshooting Guide**

**Common Recovery Issues:**

1. **Recovery Fails to Start**
   - **Symptoms**: Recovery doesn't initiate
   - **Causes**: Detection failure, permission issues, resource constraints
   - **Solutions**: Verify detection, check permissions, ensure resources available

2. **Recovery Fails Midway**
   - **Symptoms**: Recovery stops during execution
   - **Causes**: Timeout, resource issues, dependency failures
   - **Solutions**: Increase timeout, allocate resources, check dependencies

3. **Recovery Succeeds But System Still Unhealthy**
   - **Symptoms**: Recovery completes but issues persist
   - **Causes**: Incorrect strategy, incomplete recovery, underlying issues
   - **Solutions**: Analyze root cause, adjust strategy, implement comprehensive recovery

4. **Recovery Causes More Problems**
   - **Symptoms**: Recovery makes situation worse
   - **Causes**: Incorrect diagnosis, unsafe recovery, cascading failures
   - **Solutions**: Rollback recovery, re-analyze failure, use safer strategy

5. **Recovery Takes Too Long**
   - **Symptoms**: Recovery exceeds acceptable time
   - **Causes**: Complex recovery, resource constraints, inefficient procedure
   - **Solutions**: Optimize recovery, increase resources, parallelize recovery
