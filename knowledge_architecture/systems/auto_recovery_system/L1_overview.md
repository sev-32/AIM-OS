## üéØ **System Overview**

The Auto-Recovery System provides intelligent, automated recovery capabilities for all AIM-OS systems, enabling self-healing and autonomous operation without human intervention. This system ensures continuous availability and resilience through advanced failure detection, recovery planning, and automated execution.

## üèóÔ∏è **Core Architecture**

### **Failure Detection and Analysis Engine**
The system continuously monitors for failures and anomalies, detecting issues through integration with health monitoring, disconnect detection, and anomaly detection systems. It performs rapid failure identification and root cause analysis.

### **Recovery Strategy Engine**
Advanced recovery strategy engine that analyzes failures, evaluates recovery options, and selects optimal recovery strategies. It maintains a knowledge base of recovery procedures and learns from historical recovery experiences.

### **Automated Recovery Executor**
Executes recovery procedures automatically, coordinating recovery actions across multiple systems. It implements safe recovery execution with validation, rollback capabilities, and comprehensive logging.

### **Recovery Validation System**
Validates recovery success through comprehensive health checks, performance verification, and functionality testing. It ensures systems are fully recovered before declaring recovery complete.

### **Recovery Learning Engine**
Learns from recovery experiences to improve future recovery operations. It analyzes recovery effectiveness, identifies optimization opportunities, and updates recovery strategies based on outcomes.

## üîÑ **Operation Flow**

### **Failure Detection**
The system detects failures through integration with monitoring systems, analyzing health data, performance metrics, and system logs to identify issues requiring recovery.

### **Root Cause Analysis**
Advanced algorithms analyze failures to determine root causes, identify affected components, and assess recovery complexity and risk.

### **Recovery Planning**
The system evaluates recovery options, selects optimal recovery strategies, and creates detailed recovery plans with sequenced recovery actions.

### **Recovery Execution**
Automated execution of recovery procedures with real-time monitoring, validation checkpoints, and rollback capabilities if recovery fails.

### **Validation and Verification**
Comprehensive validation ensures recovery success through health checks, performance verification, functionality testing, and data integrity validation.
