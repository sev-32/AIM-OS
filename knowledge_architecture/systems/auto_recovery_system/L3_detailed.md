## üèóÔ∏è **Auto-Recovery System Implementation**

### **Core Auto-Recovery Implementation**

The Auto-Recovery System is implemented as an intelligent, autonomous framework that monitors for failures, analyzes root causes, selects optimal recovery strategies, and executes recovery procedures safely and effectively.

- Advanced root cause analysis using machine learning
- Intelligent recovery strategy selection
- Safe automated recovery execution
- Comprehensive recovery validation
- Recovery rollback capabilities
- Recovery learning and optimization

### **Recovery Data Model**

The system uses a comprehensive data model to represent recovery information:

- **FailureEvent**: Information about detected failures
- **RecoveryStrategy**: Recovery procedures and strategies
- **RecoveryPlan**: Detailed recovery execution plans

### **Failure Detection Engine**

The Failure Detection Engine monitors for failures and triggers recovery:

**Detection Methods:**
- Health monitoring integration

- Performance anomaly detection
- Log analysis and pattern recognition
- User-reported issues
- External monitoring signals

**Failure Classification:**
- Service failures (crashed services, unresponsive processes)
- Performance degradation (slow response, high latency)
- Resource exhaustion (memory leaks, disk full, CPU overload)
- Data inconsistencies (corruption, synchronization issues)
- Configuration errors (invalid settings, drift from baseline)
- Dependency failures (external service unavailable)
- Network issues (connectivity loss, timeout errors)

### **Root Cause Analysis Engine**

The Root Cause Analysis Engine diagnoses failures:

**Analysis Techniques:**
- **Log Analysis**: Analyze system logs for error patterns
