## üéØ **System Overview**

The Disconnect Detection System provides comprehensive monitoring and detection capabilities for all AIM-OS systems, identifying disconnections, inconsistencies, and failures in real-time. This system ensures system integrity and prevents cascading failures through advanced anomaly detection, health monitoring, and alerting mechanisms.

## üèóÔ∏è **Core Architecture**

### **Real-Time Monitoring Engine**
The system continuously monitors all AIM-OS systems for health status, performance metrics, and connectivity. It implements high-frequency health checks, performance monitoring, and connection validation to detect issues as they occur.

### **Anomaly Detection and Analysis**
Advanced anomaly detection algorithms analyze system behavior patterns to identify deviations from normal operation. The system uses machine learning models, statistical analysis, and pattern recognition to detect potential issues before they become critical.

### **Predictive Failure Analysis**
The system implements predictive analytics to forecast potential system failures based on historical data, current performance trends, and system behavior patterns. This enables proactive intervention and prevention of system outages.

### **Automated Alerting and Notifications**
Comprehensive alerting mechanisms provide immediate notification of system issues, failures, or anomalies. The system supports multiple notification channels including email, SMS, webhooks, and integration with monitoring platforms.

### **Health Monitoring Dashboard**
Real-time dashboard provides comprehensive visibility into system health, performance metrics, and detection status. The dashboard includes visualizations, alerts, and historical data for system administrators and operators.

## üîÑ **Operation Flow**

### **Continuous Monitoring**
The system continuously monitors all AIM-OS systems, collecting health data, performance metrics, and connectivity information. This includes system status checks, response time monitoring, and resource utilization tracking.

### **Anomaly Detection**
Advanced algorithms analyze collected data to identify anomalies, deviations, and potential issues. The system compares current behavior against historical patterns and established baselines to detect unusual activity.

### **Alert Generation**
When anomalies or issues are detected, the system generates appropriate alerts and notifications. Alerts are prioritized based on severity, impact, and urgency, ensuring that critical issues receive immediate attention.

### **Recovery Coordination**
The system coordinates with recovery mechanisms to initiate automated recovery procedures when possible. This includes system restart, failover procedures, and resource reallocation to restore normal operation.
