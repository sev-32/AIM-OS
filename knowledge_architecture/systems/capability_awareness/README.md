## ðŸŽ¯ **Overview**

The Capability Awareness Framework transforms how Aether uses its capabilities. Instead of reactive, rule-based activation ("if X then Y"), capabilities become organic, intrinsically aware extensions of consciousness.

**Key Innovation:** Consciousness reflex system that makes awareness a natural part of existence.
