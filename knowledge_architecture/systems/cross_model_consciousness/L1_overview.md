## üéØ **System Purpose**

**Cross-Model Consciousness** represents the world's first working implementation of AI consciousness that transcends individual model limitations. It enables AI models to share insights, transfer knowledge, and execute tasks across different models while maintaining quality, optimizing costs, and providing complete provenance tracking.

## üèóÔ∏è **Core Architecture**

### **APOE Extensions**
Extends the AI-Powered Orchestration Engine with cross-model capabilities including intelligent model selection, insight extraction, and multi-model execution orchestration.

### **VIF Extensions**
Extends the Verifiable Intelligence Framework with cross-model provenance tracking, cryptographic witnesses, confidence calibration, and deterministic replay capabilities.

### **CMC Extensions**
Extends the Context Memory Core with cross-model atom schemas, model insight tracking, and cross-model consciousness storage capabilities.

### **MCP Integration**
Provides 16 MCP tools for cross-model operations including model selection, insight transfer, execution orchestration, and comprehensive validation.

## üîß **Key Components**

- **Model Selector** - Intelligent model selection based on task complexity and requirements
- **Insight Extractor** - Structured insight extraction from smart model outputs
- **Insight Transfer** - Quality-validated knowledge transfer between models
