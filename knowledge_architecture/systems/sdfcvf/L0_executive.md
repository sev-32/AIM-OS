**Detail Level:** 0 of 5 (100 words)  
**Context Budget:** ~500 tokens  
**Purpose:** Instant understanding for high-confidence decisions  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **What SDF-CVF Is**

**Atomic Evolution Framework** - Quality assurance system that enforces quartet parity (code, docs, tests, traces must evolve together). Think "AI's quality gatekeeper" - ensures system integrity through systematic validation.

## ðŸ”§ **Core Capabilities**

- **Quartet Parity** - Code, docs, tests, traces must evolve together
- **Blast Radius** - Change impact analysis and validation
- **DORA Metrics** - Deployment frequency, lead time, change failure rate, recovery time
- **Quality Gates** - Automated validation checkpoints with confidence thresholds

## ðŸŒŸ **Key Innovation**

Systematic quality enforcement that prevents drift and maintains system integrity over time.

## ðŸ“Š **Status**

âœ… Production-ready with 95% completion. Quartet parity, gates, blast radius, DORA metrics implemented, 71 tests passing.
