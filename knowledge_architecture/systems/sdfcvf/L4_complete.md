## PART I: DRIFT THEORY

### 1. The Documentation Drift Problem (Formal Analysis)

**Problem Definition:**

Given a system S = (Code, Docs, Tests, Traces) evolving over time:

**Drift occurs when:**
```
∃t₁, t₂ such that t₂ > t₁ and
  alignment(Code(t₂), Docs(t₂)) < alignment(Code(t₁), Docs(t₁))
```

*Translation:* Over time, code and docs become less aligned (drift!)

**Causes of Drift:**

**C1. Independent Evolution:**  
Developers update code but forget to update docs.

**C2. Partial Updates:**  
Tests added for new code, but docs not updated to reflect new behavior.

**C3. Trace Neglect:**  
VIF witnesses not captured, so traces incomplete.

**C4. Review Gaps:**  
Code reviews check code quality but not quartet alignment.

**Drift Dynamics (Mathematical Model):**
```
Let P(t) = parity score at time t

Without SDF-CVF:
  dP/dt < 0 (parity decreases over time - drift!)
  P(t) = P(0) · e^(-λt) where λ > 0 (exponential decay)

With SDF-CVF:
  dP/dt ≥ 0 when P < 0.90 (forces alignment improvements)
  P(t) ≥ 0.90 ∀t (parity maintained!)
```

**Theorem (Drift Prevention):**  
If SDF-CVF gates are enforced with threshold P_min = 0.90, then:
  P(t) ≥ 0.90 ∀t > t_deployment

*Proof:* By gate enforcement, no change with P < 0.90 is accepted. Therefore, P can never drop below 0.90 after SDF-CVF deployment. □

### 2. Quartet Invariant (Mathematical Formulation)

**The Invariant (Formal):**

```
∀ change c at time t:
  accept(c) ⟺ 
    (|c.code| > 0 ∧ |c.docs| > 0 ∧ |c.tests| > 0 ∧ |c.traces| > 0) ∧
    P(c) ≥ P_min

Where:
  - |c.element| = count of files in element
  - P(c) = parity score of change c
  - P_min = 0.90 (threshold)
```

**Properties (Provable):**

**P1 (Completeness):**  
Every accepted change has all four quartet elements.

**P2 (Alignment):**  
Every accepted change has high alignment (P ≥ 0.90).

**P3 (Drift Prevention):**  
System parity never decreases below P_min.

**P4 (Auditability):**  
Every change has complete provenance (traces in quartet).

### 3. Parity Theory (Alignment Algebras)

**Alignment Function:**
```
align: Element × Element → [0, 1]

Properties:
  A1. align(x, x) = 1 (self-alignment perfect)
  A2. align(x, y) = align(y, x) (symmetric)
  A3. align(x, y) ∈ [0, 1] (bounded)
  
Implementation:
  align(x, y) = cosine_similarity(embed(x), embed(y))
```

**Parity Operator:**
```
P: Quartet → [0, 1]

P(code, docs, tests, traces) = 
  (align(code, docs) + align(code, tests) + align(code, traces) +
   align(docs, tests) + align(docs, traces) + align(tests, traces)) / 6

Properties:
  P1. P(q) = 1 ⟺ all elements identical (perfect alignment)
  P2. P(q) ∈ [0, 1] (bounded)
  P3. P(q) increases as elements become more similar
```

**Threshold Selection:**
```
P_min = 0.90 chosen based on:
  - Empirical studies (P ≥ 0.90 → low drift)
  - User studies (P ≥ 0.90 feels "aligned" to developers)
  - Error tolerance (allow 10% misalignment for flexibility)
```
