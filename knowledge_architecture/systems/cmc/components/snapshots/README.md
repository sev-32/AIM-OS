# Snapshots - Immutable Memory Bundles

**Component of:** CMC  
**Type:** Core Component  
**Purpose:** Content-addressed, immutable atom bundles for time-travel  
**Status:** âœ… Fully Implemented (75% of CMC)

## ðŸŽ¯ **Quick Context (100 words)**

Snapshots are immutable bundles of atoms - like Git commits for memory. Each snapshot has content-addressed ID (SHA-256 hash of contents), creation timestamp, parent reference, and atom list. Once created, never modified. Enables rollback, replay, audit. Deduplication automatic (same atoms = same hash). Snapshots form lineage chain (parentâ†’child). Every atom belongs to exactly one snapshot. Critical for determinism, time-travel queries, and verifiable replay. Think: database transaction + Git commit + Merkle tree.

## ðŸ“¦ **Snapshot Structure**

**Identity:**
- `id` - Content-addressed (snap_{hash[:16]})
- `hash` - SHA-256 of canonical representation

**Contents:**
- `atoms` - List of atom IDs in this bundle

**Lineage:**
- `parent_snapshot` - Previous snapshot (Git-like chain)

**Metadata:**
- `created_at` - Transaction timestamp
- `notes` - Human description
- `metadata` - Extensible dict

---

## ðŸ”§ **Key Operations**

**Create:**
```python
snapshot = create_snapshot(
    atoms=[atom1, atom2, atom3],
    notes="Ingested user conversation",
    parent=current_snapshot_id
)
```

**Rollback:**
```python
rollback_to_snapshot(snapshot_id)
# Marks current atoms invalid
# Restores snapshot atoms as current
```

**Diff:**
```python
diff = diff_snapshots(snap1_id, snap2_id)
# Returns: added, removed, common atoms
```

---

## ðŸ”— **Relationships**

**Snapshots used by:**
- Atoms (every atom has snapshot_id)
- VIF (replay requires snapshot)
- CMC Write Pipeline (creates snapshots)
- Rollback operations (restore state)

**Snapshots enable:**
- Time-travel (rollback to any point)
- Audit (full history preserved)
- Replay (deterministic reproduction)
- Deduplication (content addressing)

**Governed by:**
- Design Constraint C-2 (immutability)
- Memory Invariant (reversible mapping)

## ðŸŽ¯ **Key Concepts**

**Immutability:** Never modified after creation (C-2)  
**Content Addressing:** Same atoms â†’ same hash  
**Lineage Chain:** Parentâ†’child relationships (Git-like)  
**Determinism:** Reproducible, verifiable  
**Deduplication:** Automatic via hashing
