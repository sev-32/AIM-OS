## üéØ **System Overview**

The Health Monitoring System provides comprehensive, real-time health tracking and monitoring for all AIM-OS systems. This system ensures optimal system performance and reliability through advanced health checks, performance monitoring, resource tracking, and availability validation.

## üèóÔ∏è **Core Architecture**

### **Real-Time Health Tracking Engine**
The system continuously monitors the health status of all AIM-OS systems, collecting vital signs, performance metrics, and operational indicators. It implements high-frequency health checks, comprehensive status validation, and real-time health assessments.

### **Performance Monitoring and Analysis**
Advanced performance monitoring capabilities track system performance metrics, identify performance trends, and detect performance degradation. The system provides detailed performance analytics and historical trend analysis for capacity planning.

### **Resource Utilization Monitoring**
Comprehensive resource monitoring tracks CPU, memory, disk, and network utilization across all systems. It provides real-time resource usage data, identifies resource bottlenecks, and enables proactive resource management.

### **Availability and Uptime Tracking**
The system tracks system availability, uptime, and service level objectives (SLOs). It provides availability reporting, uptime statistics, and SLO compliance monitoring to ensure systems meet availability targets.

### **Health Dashboards and Reporting**
Real-time dashboards provide comprehensive visibility into system health across all AIM-OS components. The system includes customizable dashboards, detailed health reports, and historical health analytics.

## üîÑ **Operation Flow**

### **Health Data Collection**
The system continuously collects health data from all AIM-OS systems, including status indicators, performance metrics, resource utilization, and operational parameters.

### **Health Assessment**
Advanced algorithms assess system health based on collected data, applying health rules, threshold checks, and trend analysis to determine overall system health status.

### **Trend Analysis**
The system analyzes health trends over time, identifying patterns, detecting anomalies, and predicting potential health issues before they become critical.

### **Alert Generation**
When health issues are detected, the system generates appropriate alerts and notifications, ensuring that operators are informed of health concerns immediately.
