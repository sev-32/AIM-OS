# Automation Test Setup

**Date:** 2025-10-21  
**Status:** 🧪 **READY TO TEST**  
**Purpose:** Test if AI can replicate fractal documentation pattern

---

## 🎯 **The Experiment**

**Hypothesis:** AI can replicate the fractal documentation pattern demonstrated in CMC and HHNI

**Method:** Provide AI with CMC + HHNI as examples, ask it to document APOE

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Structure matches CMC/HHNI pattern
- ✅ Technical accuracy >90%
- ✅ Cross-references correct
- ✅ Navigation clear
- ✅ Quality maintained (A or A-)
- ✅ Minimal human corrections needed (<20%)

---

## 📊 **Training Data**

### **Example System 1: CMC (50% complete)**
**Files:** 40  
**Words:** ~15,000  
**Structure:**
- README + L1-L3 (system level)
- 4 components (Atoms 70%, others 20%)
- 6 field-level docs
- implementation_map, PROGRESS

**Location:** `knowledge_architecture/systems/cmc/`

---

### **Example System 2: HHNI (50% complete)**
**Files:** 26  
**Words:** ~18,000  
**Structure:**
- README + L1-L3 (system level)
- 6 components (all 30-40% with README + L1)
- implementation_map, PROGRESS

**Location:** `knowledge_architecture/systems/hhni/`

---

## 🎯 **Test Case: APOE**

**Why APOE:**
- ✅ Well-understood system (55% implemented)
- ✅ Good documentation exists (analysis/themes/orchestration.md)
- ✅ Working code (packages/apoe_runner/, orchestration_builder/)
- ✅ Different enough from CMC/HHNI (tests pattern generalization)
- ✅ Clear components (ACL, Roles, DEPP, Gates, Budget)

**Expected Difficulty:** Medium (similar complexity to CMC/HHNI)

---

## 📋 **Test Prompt (For AI)**

```markdown
# Task: Document APOE System Using Fractal Pattern

## Context
You have access to two example systems that demonstrate the fractal documentation pattern:
1. CMC (Context Memory Core) - 40 files at knowledge_architecture/systems/cmc/
2. HHNI (Hierarchical Index) - 26 files at knowledge_architecture/systems/hhni/

## Your Task
Create complete documentation for APOE (AI-Powered Orchestration Engine) following the EXACT pattern demonstrated in CMC and HHNI.

## Source Materials
1. Code: packages/apoe_runner/, packages/orchestration_builder/
2. Design docs: analysis/themes/orchestration.md
3. Thesis: analysis/raw/A Total System of Memory.txt (Chapters 11-13)
4. Tests: packages/apoe_runner/tests/ (if exist)

## Required Deliverables

### System Level (60% of system docs)
1. README.md - Navigation + context budget guide
2. L1_overview.md - 500 words (architecture overview)
3. L2_architecture.md - 2k words (technical specification)
4. L3_detailed.md - 10k words (implementation deep dive)
5. implementation_map.md - Map docs to code
6. PROGRESS.md - Track completion status

### Component Level (40% of system docs)
For each APOE component (ACL, Roles, DEPP, Gates, Budget), create:
1. Component README.md - Navigation + 100w summary
2. Component L1_overview.md - 500w component architecture

Minimum 5 components expected.

## Pattern Requirements

### Every README Must Include:
- 100-word quick context summary
- Context budget guide (4k, 8k, 32k, 200k, 1M)
- Navigate by task/role section
- Key concepts
- Relationships (feeds/uses/governed by)
- Current implementation status
- Detail level navigation

### Every L1-L3 Must Include:
- Proper word count (L1: ~500, L2: ~2k, L3: ~10k)
- Technical accuracy (verified against code)
- Cross-references to other systems
- Implementation details
- Examples and use cases
- Current status and tests

### Cross-References Required:
- APOE uses CMC (retrieves context)
- APOE uses HHNI (via CMC)
- APOE feeds VIF (witnesses execution)
- APOE feeds SEG (execution traces)
- APOE governed by SDF-CVF (plan parity)

## Success Criteria

**Structure (30%):**
- ✅ Follows CMC/HHNI directory structure
- ✅ Same file naming pattern
- ✅ Same documentation levels

**Content (40%):**
- ✅ Technical accuracy >90%
- ✅ Covers all major components
- ✅ Examples and code snippets present
- ✅ Clear explanations

**Cross-References (20%):**
- ✅ All relationships documented
- ✅ Links to other systems correct
- ✅ Implementation mapped accurately

**Quality (10%):**
- ✅ Consistent formatting
- ✅ Professional tone
- ✅ Navigation clear
- ✅ Usable by AI builders

## Evaluation Process

1. Generate all required files
2. Human review for accuracy
3. Score against criteria (0-100%)
4. **If ≥70%:** Automation validated! ✅
5. **If <70%:** Identify gaps, iterate or continue manual

## Timeline

**AI Generation:** 2-4 hours (estimated)  
**Human Review:** 4-6 hours  
**Total:** 6-10 hours for test

**vs. Manual:** ~100 hours for same depth  
**Potential Savings:** 90% if automation works!

### **Scenario B: Automation Partial (50-69%)** 📝
**Result:**
- ✅ AI understands structure
- ❌ Quality/accuracy issues
- 🔄 Needs refinement

**Next Steps:**
- Identify specific gaps
- Improve examples or prompt
- Test again with adjustments
- Hybrid: AI generates, human refines

**Timeline:** ~600 hours (vs ~900 manual) - **33% savings**

---

### **Scenario C: Automation Fails (<50%)** 📚
**Result:**
- ❌ Pattern too complex for current AI
- ❌ Needs more examples
- ✅ Still learned what doesn't work!

**Next Steps:**
- Continue manual for all 6 core systems
- Create comprehensive gold standard
- Test automation again with 6 examples
- Future: Better AI models might work

**Timeline:** ~900 hours (all manual) - **But higher quality!**

---

## 🎯 **My Prediction**

**Likely Outcome:** Scenario B (50-70%)

**Reasoning:**
- Pattern is consistent (AI should recognize)
- Examples are comprehensive (good training)
- Technical accuracy harder (requires code understanding)
- Cross-references complex (requires system knowledge)

**Expected:** AI gets structure right, needs accuracy corrections

**Value:** Even at 60%, saves 40% of time!
