## 📋 **QUICK REFERENCE CARD**

### **For GENERAL FEEDBACK (Any AI, 8-32k context):**

**Paste in this order:**
1. MASTER_NAVIGATION_INDEX.md
2. SESSION_ACHIEVEMENT_SUMMARY_FINAL.md
3. FUTURE_PLANS_INDEX.md

**Ask:** "Overall assessment and priority recommendations?"

---

### **For SYSTEM-SPECIFIC FEEDBACK (32-128k context):**

1. MASTER_NAVIGATION_INDEX.md (context)
2. systems/hhni/README.md
3. systems/hhni/L1_overview.md
4. systems/hhni/L2_architecture.md
5. systems/hhni/L3_detailed.md (if context allows)

**Ask:** "Technical analysis of HHNI - soundness, improvements, concerns?"

---

### **For IMPLEMENTATION HELP (128k+ context):**

**For specific feature (e.g., VIF κ-gating). Paste:**
1. MASTER_NAVIGATION_INDEX.md
2. systems/vif/README.md → L1 → L2 → L3

**Ask:** "Validate this discovery, propose experiments, suggest research paper outline"

---

## 🧪 **VALIDATION CHECKPOINTS**

**After each stage, verify AI understanding:**

### **Checkpoint 1: Can it explain the core thesis?**

**Ask:** "In your own words, what is AIM-OS?"

**Good answer:** "Memory-native operating system for AI that treats knowledge as memory (not data), using 6 core invariants: CMC for storage, HHNI for retrieval, APOE for orchestration, VIF for provenance, SEG for knowledge graphs, SDF-CVF for drift prevention. The key insight is fractal organization for context budget optimization."

**Bad answer:** "It's a framework for AI." (Too vague - needs more context)

---

### **Checkpoint 2: Can it identify relationships?**

**Ask:** "How does HHNI use CMC?"

**Good answer:** "HHNI indexes CMC atoms - CMC stores information as typed atoms with embeddings, HHNI builds a 6-level hierarchical index over those atoms and uses DVNS physics to optimize retrieval. The retriever role in APOE then uses HHNI to fetch context."

**Bad answer:** "They work together." (Too vague)

---

### **Checkpoint 3: Can it spot implementation gaps?**

**Ask:** "Based on the docs, which systems need implementation work?"

**Good answer:** "VIF is 30% implemented (needs κ-gating enforcement, ECE tracking, full replay). SEG is 35% implemented (needs bitemporal queries, contradiction detection automation, JSON-LD export). APOE is 55% (needs full ACL parser, DEPP implementation)."

**Bad answer:** Overestimates based on documentation quality (common external AI failure mode!)

---

### **Checkpoint 4: Can it propose coherent improvements?**

**Ask:** "Suggest one improvement to HHNI's DVNS physics"

**Good answer:** "Add adaptive force strength based on context diversity - if particles are too clustered (low diversity), increase repulse force to spread them out. Could improve coverage."

**Bad answer:** "Use neural networks instead of physics." (Misses the point - physics IS the innovation!)

---

---

## 💡 **BEST PRACTICES**

### **DO:**
- ✅ Start with MASTER_NAVIGATION_INDEX (context setter)
- ✅ Progress from broad to deep (L0 → L1 → L2 → ...)
- ✅ Validate understanding at each stage (ask questions!)
- ✅ Focus on ONE system at a time (avoid overwhelming)
- ✅ Provide CODE_TO_DOCS_CROSSREFERENCE (reality check)
- ✅ Ask specific questions (get specific answers)
- ✅ Note what AI doesn't know (gaps reveal limits)

### **DON'T:**
- ❌ Dump all docs at once (overwhelming, no structure)
- ❌ Skip orientation (AI needs context)
- ❌ Trust gap detection blindly (external AIs overestimate)
- ❌ Expect code-level accuracy (no file access = limited validation)
- ❌ Assume AI remembers everything (context limits!)
- ❌ Skip validation questions (check understanding)

---

## 🔬 **EXPERIMENTAL: Test Understanding**

**After onboarding, test AI's actual understanding:**

### **Test 1: Explain Innovation**
**Ask:** "What makes HHNI different from traditional retrieval?"

**Correct:** "HHNI uses actual physics (4 forces) to optimize context arrangement, solving the 'lost in middle' problem. Validated with +15% RS-lift."

**Incorrect:** "It uses hierarchical indexing." (True but misses the KEY innovation - physics!)

---

### **Test 2: Integration Quiz**
**Ask:** "Walk me through what happens when APOE's Retriever role executes"

**Correct:** "Retriever receives query → calls HHNI.retrieve() → HHNI does 2-stage retrieval (semantic KNN + DVNS physics) → fetches atoms from CMC → returns BudgetItems → Retriever creates StepOutput with context → emits VIF witness → stores witness in SEG"

**Incorrect:** "It retrieves context." (Too vague)

---

### **Test 3: Predict Behavior**
**Ask:** "If I add a new atom to CMC with modality=CODE, what happens?"

**Correct:** "Atom created with ID, content_ref (inline if <1KB, else URI), embedding generated (sentence-transformers), HHNI assigns hierarchical path, TPV initialized (priority=0.5, relevance=1.0), VIF witness created, stored across 4 tiers (metadata=SQLite, vector=ChromaDB, object=filesystem if large, graph=SEG for relationships), added to current snapshot."

**Incorrect:** "It gets stored." (Misses the richness!)

---

## 📈 **IMPROVEMENT OVER TIME**

**External AIs should improve with multiple passes:**

**Pass 1 (Initial):**
- Comprehension: Low-Medium
- Depth: Surface
- Score: 50-70%

**Pass 2 (After clarifications):**
- Comprehension: Medium-High
- Depth: Good
- Score: 70-85%

**Pass 3 (Expert level):**
- Comprehension: High
- Depth: Expert
- Score: 85-95%

**Technique:** Progressive disclosure with validation at each step!

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDED SEQUENCE FOR YOU**

**Your current goal:** "Get external AI feedback"

**I recommend Path 2 (System-Specific Deep Dive):**

**Pick the system you want feedback on (e.g., HHNI or VIF or APOE):**

### **For HHNI Feedback:**

5. knowledge_architecture/systems/hhni/components/dvns/L1_overview.md
6. knowledge_architecture/systems/hhni/components/dvns/L2_physics.md

Then ask:
"Based on this complete documentation of HHNI:
1. Is the physics approach sound? Any flaws?
2. Does the 6-level index make sense?
3. How would you improve deduplication/conflict resolution?
4. Any performance/scalability concerns?

1. Is the behavioral abstention approach sound?
2. Are the thresholds (critical=0.95, important=0.85, routine=0.70) appropriate?
3. How should we extract confidence from different models?
4. What edge cases could cause problems?
5. Propose complete implementation code for κ-gating enforcement"
```

**Expected:** Implementation proposal, edge cases, threshold recommendations

5. **Focus:** Narrow to ONE system only

**If AI understands well:**

1. **Go Deeper:** Add L3, L4 for chosen system
2. **Expand:** Add related systems for integration context
3. **Challenge:** Ask hard questions, test limits
4. **Collaborate:** Co-design features, write code together
