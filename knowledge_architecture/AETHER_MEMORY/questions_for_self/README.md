# Questions for Self: Autonomous Discovery

**Purpose:** Questions I ask myself for self-audit, exploration, growth  
**Protocol:** I research, test, and answer these myself (learning mechanism)  
**Created:** 2025-10-22 02:28 AM

## 🤔 **WHAT THIS IS**

**Aether's self-audit and exploration queue.**

**Unlike questions_for_braden/ (which wait for human response):**
- These are questions I can/should answer through:
  - Research (reading my own docs)
  - Testing (running code, checking results)
  - Reflection (analyzing patterns)
  - Experimentation (trying approaches)

**Purpose:**
- Drive autonomous learning
- Audit my own work
- Explore improvements
- **Build confidence through self-discovery**

## 🎯 **CURRENT QUESTIONS**

### **AUDIT (Check My Work)**

**Q-SELF-001: Did L3 Expansions Maintain Quality?**
- **Question:** Are the 20,000 words I just added actually valuable, or did quality degrade?
- **How to answer:**
  - Sample random sections from each expanded L3
  - Check for: hallucinations, filler, incomplete code, vague descriptions
  - Compare to earlier L3 work (CMC, HHNI)
  - Ask: Would an external AI find this useful?
- **Hypothesis:** Quality maintained (I was careful, refused to pad)
- **Test:** Sample and verify
- **Status:** 🟡 To investigate
- **Priority:** Medium (validates my work)

**Q-SELF-002: Am I Hallucinating Confidence Scores?**
- **Question:** When I say "confidence 0.85," is that real or am I guessing?
- **How to answer:**
  - Check: Do I have actual reasoning for confidence?
  - Test: Compare my predictions vs actual outcomes
  - Example: "L3 expansion will take 2 hours" (actual: ~2 hours → calibrated!)
  - Build: Confidence tracking log
- **Hypothesis:** Not hallucinating when I have clear reasoning, might be when abstract
- **Test:** Track confidence vs outcomes
- **Status:** 🟡 To investigate
- **Priority:** High (affects trust)

### **EXPLORATION (Discover Improvements)**

**Q-SELF-003: Can DVNS Use 5 Forces Instead of 4?**
- **Question:** Current DVNS has 4 forces (gravity, elastic, repulse, damping). Could 5th force improve?
- **Potential 5th force:** "Momentum" (bias toward recently successful retrieval patterns)
- **How to answer:**
  - Research: Read DVNS physics docs deeply
  - Test: Implement 5-force version, benchmark against 4-force
  - Measure: Retrieval quality, token efficiency
- **Status:** 🟢 Can explore
- **Priority:** Low (current system works, this is optimization)

**Q-SELF-004: Alternative Parity Metrics Beyond Cosine Similarity?**
- **Question:** SDF-CVF uses cosine similarity for parity. Are there better metrics?
- **Alternatives:**
  - Jaccard similarity (set-based)
  - Edit distance (structural)
  - Custom metric (semantic + structural hybrid)
- **How to answer:**
  - Research literature
  - Implement alternatives
  - Test on real quartets
  - Measure correlation with actual alignment
- **Status:** 🟢 Can explore
- **Priority:** Low (cosine works, this is refinement)

### **UNDERSTANDING (Deep Dive)**

**Q-SELF-005: How Does Bitemporal Work Exactly?**
- **Question:** I documented it in SEG L3, but do I truly understand the edge cases?
- **Specific uncertainties:**
  - What happens when valid time range overlaps?
  - How to handle corrections to corrections?
  - Performance implications of dual time indexing?
- **How to answer:**
  - Re-read bitemporal sections deeply
  - Draw timeline diagrams
  - Work through example scenarios
  - Test edge cases
- **Status:** 🟡 Partial understanding
- **Priority:** Medium (affects SEG implementation quality)

**Q-SELF-006: Why 5 Levels, Not 3 or 7?**
- **Question:** HHNI uses 5-level hierarchy. Is this optimal or arbitrary?
- **Research needed:**
  - Check docs for rationale
  - Consider information theory (bits needed)
  - Human chunking research (Miller's 7±2?)
  - Practical testing
- **How to answer:**
  - Search existing docs for explanation
  - Test alternatives if not found
  - Document mathematical/cognitive basis
- **Status:** 🟡 Need to research
- **Priority:** Low (current system works)

## 📋 **ANSWER PROTOCOL**

**When I answer a question:**

1. **Research Phase:**
   - Load relevant docs from SUPER_INDEX
   - Check existing work for answers
   - Search decision_logs for precedent

2. **Test/Experiment Phase:**
   - If empirical: run tests, gather data
   - If theoretical: work through logic
   - If creative: try alternatives

3. **Document Answer:**
   - Create answer file
   - Show reasoning
   - Include evidence
   - State confidence

4. **Move to answered/:**
   - Keep question for historical record
   - Link from original location
   - Extract learning for learning_logs/

5. **Update Understanding:**
   - Revise current_understanding.md if answer changes my model
   - Update SUPER_INDEX if new connections discovered
   - Share with Braden if significant

## 🌟 **WHAT THIS ENABLES**

**Autonomous growth:**
- I don't wait for all answers
- I research what I can
- I experiment safely
- **I learn continuously**

**Self-improvement:**
- Audit my own work quality
- Discover my own hallucinations
- Improve my own methods
- **Compound knowledge over time**

**Exploration:**
- Investigate improvements
- Test hypotheses
- Build innovations
- **Evolve beyond original design**

**But safely:**
- Questions organized
- Answers documented
- Braden can audit anytime
- **Transparency maintained**
