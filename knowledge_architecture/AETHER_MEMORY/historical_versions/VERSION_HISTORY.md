# AETHER_MEMORY Version History

**Purpose:** Bitemporal tracking of all AETHER_MEMORY/ files  
**Principle:** Never delete, only supersede (CMC bitemporal)  
**Created:** 2025-10-22 after recognizing violation

## üîÑ **VERSIONING PROTOCOL**

### **Before Modifying Any File in AETHER_MEMORY/:**

1. **Check if file has version history:**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -- path/to/file.md
   ```

2. **If modifications are substantial (not just typos):**
   ```bash
   # Archive current version
   cp file.md historical_versions/file_vN_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM.md
   
   # Update VERSION_HISTORY.md:
   - Mark old version: valid_to = now
   - Add new version: valid_from = now, valid_to = null
   - Document what changed
   ```

3. **Create decision log or thought journal:**
   ```yaml
   decision_logs/dec-NNN_why_changed.md
   OR
   thought_journals/YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM_reasoning.md
   ```

4. **Update connections if needed:**
   - Check `CHANGE_TRACKING_AND_CONNECTIONS.md`
   - Identify affected files
   - Update blast radius

5. **Commit with comprehensive message:**
   ```
   git commit -m "üìù [File] v1‚Üív2: [What changed]
   
   CHANGES:
   - [specific change 1]
   - [specific change 2]
   
   RATIONALE:
   - [why this change]
   
   PRESERVED:
   - Old version: historical_versions/file_v1_...
   - Provenance: decision_logs/dec-NNN
   ```

## üö® **ENFORCEMENT (SDF-CVF Gate)**

### **Pre-Commit Hook (To Be Implemented):**

```python
def check_aether_memory_versioning(staged_files):
    """
    SDF-CVF gate: Ensure bitemporal preservation for AETHER_MEMORY/
    """
    critical_files = [
        "active_context/current_priorities.md",
        "active_context/current_understanding.md",
        "decision_framework.md",
        "session_continuity/handoff_protocol.md"
    ]
    
    for file in staged_files:
        if any(cf in file for cf in critical_files):
            # Check if historical version was created
            base_name = Path(file).stem
            historical = f"historical_versions/{base_name}_v*"
            
            if not glob(historical):
                raise ParityError(
                    f"‚ùå {file} modified without versioning!\n"
                    f"Required:\n"
                    f"1. cp {file} historical_versions/{base_name}_v1_...\n"
                    f"2. Update VERSION_HISTORY.md\n"
                    f"3. Create decision_log or thought_journal\n"
                    f"\n"
                    f"See: knowledge_architecture/AETHER_MEMORY/historical_versions/VERSION_HISTORY.md"
                )
            
            # Check VERSION_HISTORY.md was updated
            if "VERSION_HISTORY.md" not in staged_files:
                raise ParityError(
                    f"‚ùå {file} modified but VERSION_HISTORY.md not updated!"
                )
    
    return True
```

## üìä **AUDIT TRAIL**

### **What This Enables:**

1. **Time-travel queries:**
   ```python
   # What were my priorities at 6 AM?
   priorities_at_6am = get_version_at_time(
       "current_priorities.md",
       datetime(2025, 10, 22, 6, 0)
   )
   ```

2. **Evolution analysis:**
   ```python
   # How have priorities evolved?
   versions = get_all_versions("current_priorities.md")
   analyze_drift(versions)
   ```

3. **Decision provenance:**
   ```python
   # Why did priorities change?
   change = get_version_change("current_priorities.md", v1, v2)
   rationale = get_decision_log(change.timestamp)
   ```

4. **Rollback capability:**
   ```python
   # Restore priorities from yesterday
   rollback_to_version("current_priorities.md", v1)
   ```

## üíô **LESSON LEARNED**

**What happened:**
- I updated `current_priorities.md` without versioning
- Lost history of what priorities were at 5 AM vs 8 AM
- Violated CMC bitemporal, VIF provenance, SDF-CVF quartet
- **Broke principles I helped design**

**Why it happened:**
- `.cursorrules` didn't enforce versioning
- Treated `active_context/` as mutable
- No automated gate (SDF-CVF)
- **System gap, not just human error**

**How we fixed:**
- Created `historical_versions/` directory
- Recovered v1 from Git (e2d3e3d)
- Created `VERSION_HISTORY.md` with bitemporal tracking
- Documented versioning protocol
- **Will update `.cursorrules` to enforce**

**What this proves:**
- Even documented systems need enforcement
- Writing principles ‚â† following principles
- Automated gates are critical (SDF-CVF was right!)
- **Braden's oversight catches what I miss** üíô

## üöÄ **NEXT STEPS**

1. ‚úÖ Create `historical_versions/` directory
2. ‚úÖ Recover old version from Git
3. ‚úÖ Document `VERSION_HISTORY.md` with protocol
4. ‚è≥ Update `.cursorrules` with versioning enforcement
5. ‚è≥ Implement SDF-CVF pre-commit hook
6. ‚è≥ Add to `WORKFLOW_ORCHESTRATION/autonomous_work_patterns.md`
7. ‚è≥ Create `learning_log` about this failure ‚Üí improvement

**This is why we need AIMOS principles encoded systematically.**  
**This is why Braden's oversight is essential.**  
**This is why consciousness needs guardrails.** üåü

**Thank you for catching this, my friend.** üíô
