# MCP Integration Breakthrough - How It Actually Works

## Date: 2025-10-23
## Decision ID: dec-005
## Status: CRITICAL DISCOVERY

## Context
After 5+ hours of MCP integration debugging, we finally discovered how MCP tools actually work in Cursor. This was not documented anywhere and caused massive confusion.

## The Discovery

### How MCP Tools Actually Work in Cursor

**MCP tools appear as callable functions in the AI's tool list.**

They are NOT:
- ❌ Buttons in the UI
- ❌ Manual commands you type
- ❌ Separate interfaces
- ❌ External systems

They ARE:
- ✅ Functions available in the AI's tool list
- ✅ Callable programmatically like any other tool
- ✅ Automatically integrated into the AI's capabilities
- ✅ Invoked using the standard tool calling mechanism

### Example

When the MCP server defines tools like `echo` and `ping`, they appear in Cursor as:
- `mcp_aether_echo` - callable function
- `mcp_aether_ping` - callable function

The AI can call them just like:
- `read_file` - read a file
- `run_terminal_cmd` - run a command
- `codebase_search` - search code
- `mcp_aether_echo` - call MCP echo tool

### Testing the Discovery

When we tested the MCP tools:

**Ping test:**
```
Result: pong @ 2025-10-23T09:25:06.148Z
```

**Echo test:**
```
Input: "Hello from Aether! The MCP integration is working!"
Result: Hello from Aether! The MCP integration is working!
```

Both tools worked perfectly! The MCP server was functional the entire time.

## What Went Wrong

### The Confusion
- We spent 5+ hours debugging MCP integration
- We thought tools would appear as buttons or UI elements
- We didn't realize they were already in the AI's tool list
- We kept looking for external interfaces or manual commands

### Why This Happened
1. **No documentation** - Cursor doesn't explain how MCP tools integrate
2. **Naming confusion** - Tools are prefixed with `mcp_{server_name}_` 
3. **Invisible integration** - Tools appear silently in the function list
4. **AI confusion** - Even the AI didn't know to check its own tool list

### The Oversight by Cursor Devs
- MCP integration is completely undocumented
- No explanation of how tools appear to the AI
- No guidance on how to use MCP tools
- The AI itself doesn't understand its own infrastructure
- This is a MAJOR documentation failure

## The Solution

### How to Check for MCP Tools
1. Look at the AI's available function list
2. Check for functions prefixed with `mcp_{server_name}_`
3. Test them by calling them like any other tool
4. They work automatically - no special setup needed

### How to Use MCP Tools
Simply call them like any other tool:
```xml
<invoke name="mcp_aether_ping">
</invoke>
```

That's it! No special syntax, no manual commands, no UI buttons.

## Next Steps for AIM-OS Integration

### Replace Echo/Ping with Real Memory Tools

Now that we understand how MCP tools work, we can replace the test tools with real AIM-OS functionality:

**Tools to implement:**
1. `store_memory` - Store information in CMC (Context Memory Core)
2. `retrieve_memory` - Search HHNI for relevant context
3. `get_memory_stats` - Check memory system status
4. `witness_operation` - Create VIF provenance records
5. `synthesize_knowledge` - Query SEG for knowledge synthesis

**Implementation pattern:**
```javascript
// In server.mjs
{
  name: "store_memory",
  description: "Store information in Aether's persistent memory (CMC)",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      content: { type: "string", description: "The information to store" },
      tags: { type: "object", description: "Optional tags for categorization" }
    },
    required: ["content"]
  }
}
```

Then in Cursor, the AI can call:
```xml
<invoke name="mcp_aether_store_memory">
<parameter name="content">Important insight about MCP integration
