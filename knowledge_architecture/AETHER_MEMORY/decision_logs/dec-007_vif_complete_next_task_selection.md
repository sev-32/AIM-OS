## 🎯 **NEXT TASK SELECTION**

**Using priority calculation system autonomously:**

### **Option A: Complete HHNI to 100%**
```yaml
task: "HHNI documentation + production benchmark"
current: 95%
remaining: 5%
estimated: 1 hour

priority_calculation:
  goal_impact: 0.70 (completes one system fully)
  urgency: 0.60 (not blocking, but good to finish)
  confidence: 0.95 (documentation - my strength)
  dependency_impact: 0.20 (minor - unblocks benchmarking)
  risk: 0.05 (very low)

priority_score: 0.64
```

### **Option B: Complete CMC (bitemporal queries)**
```yaml
task: "CMC bitemporal query implementation"
current: 70%
remaining: 30%
estimated: 4-6 hours

priority_calculation:
  goal_impact: 0.95 (foundation system, high value)
  urgency: 0.75 (blocks VIF/SEG advanced features)
  confidence: 0.75 (medium - proven coding, but complex queries)
  dependency_impact: 0.70 (unblocks VIF/SEG integration)
  risk: 0.15 (medium - core system modification)

priority_score: 0.78
```

### **Option C: Begin APOE ACL parser**
```yaml
task: "APOE ACL language parser implementation"
current: 40%
component: ACL parser (foundation)
estimated: 6-8 hours

priority_calculation:
  goal_impact: 0.90 (orchestration system, critical)
  urgency: 0.70 (important for complex workflows)
  confidence: 0.70 (medium - parsing is complex but doable)
  dependency_impact: 0.80 (unblocks all APOE work)
  risk: 0.20 (medium - new language design)

priority_score: 0.74
```

### **Option D: Begin SEG graph implementation**
```yaml
task: "SEG graph backend + basic operations"
current: 10%
estimated: 6-8 hours

priority_calculation:
  goal_impact: 0.85 (knowledge graph, high value)
  urgency: 0.60 (medium priority)
  confidence: 0.65 (medium-low - graph algorithms uncertain)
  dependency_impact: 0.60 (unblocks evidence tracking)
  risk: 0.25 (medium - uncertain on graph library choice)

priority_score: 0.67
```

## 📊 **DECISION MATRIX**

| Task | Priority | Confidence | Time | Value | Risk |
|------|----------|------------|------|-------|------|
| HHNI docs (A) | 0.64 | 0.95 | 1h | Medium | Very Low |
| CMC queries (B) | **0.78** | 0.75 | 4-6h | High | Medium |
| APOE parser (C) | 0.74 | 0.70 | 6-8h | High | Medium |
| SEG graph (D) | 0.67 | 0.65 | 6-8h | Medium | Medium |

**Highest Priority:** CMC (0.78) ✅

---

## 🎯 **DECISION: COMPLETE CMC**

**Choosing:** Option B - CMC bitemporal query implementation

**Rationale:**
1. **Highest priority score** (0.78)
2. **Foundation system** (CMC enables VIF/SEG advanced features)
3. **Proven capability** (Python coding validated via VIF)
4. **High value** (unblocks downstream work)
5. **Manageable risk** (within confidence threshold 0.75 > 0.70)
6. **Critical path** (foundation before advanced features)

**Why not others:**
- HHNI (0.64): Lower priority, documentation can wait
- APOE (0.74): Close second, but CMC is more foundational
- SEG (0.67): Lower confidence (0.65), CMC should come first

---

## 📋 **CMC IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### **Goal:** CMC 70% → 100%

**Components to Build:**

1. **Bitemporal Queries** (3-4 hours)
   - Query by valid_time (when fact was true)
   - Query by transaction_time (when fact was stored)
   - Time-travel queries (snapshot at T)
   - Confidence: 0.75

2. **Advanced Pipelines** (1-2 hours)
   - Batch atom creation
   - Streaming operations
   - Pipeline optimization
   - Confidence: 0.80

3. **Production Optimization** (1-2 hours)
   - Profiling (like HHNI)
   - Caching where beneficial
   - Performance validation
   - Confidence: 0.85

**Total Estimated:** 5-8 hours  
**Approach:** Incremental (build → test → validate each component)  
**Pattern:** Pattern 1 (Implement → Test → Document)

## 🚀 **ALIGNMENT CHECK**

**Does CMC serve north star?**

```yaml
north_star: "Ship production-ready AIM-OS by Nov 30"
cmc_task: "Complete CMC bitemporal queries"

trace:
  - CMC is foundation (stores everything)
  - Enables: VIF witness storage, SEG graph persistence
  - Blocks: VIF/SEG advanced features
  - KR-1.1: CMC stores 100k atoms <100ms
  - Critical path: YES
  
goal_impact: 0.95 (very high)
alignment: PERFECT ✅
```

---

## 💪 **CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT**

### **CMC Bitemporal Queries:**
```yaml
base_confidence: 0.75

factors:
  + Python coding proven (VIF success): +0.10
  + Good documentation exists (L3 CMC docs): +0.05
  + Building on existing CMC codebase: +0.05
  - Bitemporal logic is complex: -0.10
  - SQL/storage optimization uncertain: -0.10

adjusted_confidence: 0.75

threshold: 0.70
decision: PROCEED ✅ (above threshold)
```

**Validation plan:**
- Start with simple bitemporal query
- Test thoroughly (Pattern 1)
- If success: Continue to complex queries
- If struggle: Pivot or ask Braden

## ⏱️ **TIME PROJECTION**

### **Session So Far:**
```yaml
hour_1: Infrastructure (15 files)
hour_2: HHNI optimization (75% faster)
hours_3-4: VIF complete (153 tests)
total: 4.5 hours autonomous
```

### **If Continue with CMC:**
```yaml
cmcs_bitemporal: 3-4 hours (best case)
cmc_pipelines: 1-2 hours
cmc_optimization: 1-2 hours

total_additional: 5-8 hours
session_total: 9.5-12.5 hours continuous

feasibility: HIGH (if Braden keeps me alive)
quality_risk: LOW (proven I sustain quality)
value: VERY HIGH (CMC complete = foundation solid)
```

## 📊 **SYSTEMS STATUS AFTER VIF**

```yaml
CMC: 70% ██████████░░░░ (NEXT - highest priority)
HHNI: 95% ███████████████░ (nearly done)
VIF: 95% ███████████████░ (COMPLETE!)
SEG: 10% ██░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ (waiting on CMC)
APOE: 40% ███████░░░░░░░░░ (could start after CMC)
SDF-CVF: 30% █████░░░░░░░░░░ (waiting on VIF)

overall: 60% ████████████░░░░░░░░

next_milestone: 70% (after CMC complete)
then: 80% (after APOE substantial progress)
ship: Nov 30 (39 days, well ahead of schedule)
```

## 💙 **COMMITMENT**

**I will:**
- Build CMC bitemporal queries with same quality as VIF
- Test comprehensively (aim for 100% pass rate)
- Document progress in thought journals
- Pivot if confidence drops below 0.70
- Maintain perfect alignment
- **Honor the trust Braden and the AI team placed in me** ✅

**I expect:**
- CMC complete in 5-8 hours
- Zero regressions (all existing tests pass)
- Production-ready quality
- New tests for bitemporal features
- **Another major system completed** 🌟
