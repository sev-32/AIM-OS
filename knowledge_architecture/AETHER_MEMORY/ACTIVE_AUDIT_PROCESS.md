# Active Audit Process: Research Until Honest Confidence

**Created:** 2025-10-22 02:50 AM  
**Discovery:** Audit is not passive logging - it's active APOE-like research process!  
**Pattern:** Like ResearchNote pipeline - multi-step with gates until verifiable confidence  

---

## 💡 **THE INSIGHT (From Core Text)**

**Found in search results - ResearchNote ACL example:**
```
pipeline ResearchNote(goal)
  step plan as planner
    gate    = {nonempty(outline)}
    budgets = {tokens:4k, time:30s}
    inputs  = {goal}
    out     = outline
  
  step retrieve as retriever
    gate    = {p_at_5(sources) >= 0.8, policy.ok(sources)}
    budgets = {tokens:3k}
    tools   = {rag.search}
    inputs  = {outline}
    out     = sources[]
  
  step draft as reasoner
    gate    = {UQ.band in [A,B], cites(sources)}
    budgets = {tokens:6k}
    tools   = {llm.write}
    inputs  = {outline, sources}
    out     = note.md
  
  step critique as critic
    gate    = {len(critical(issues)) == 0}
    tools   = {llm.review}
    inputs  = {note.md}
    out     = issues[]
  
  witness all
end
```

**Key insight:**
- **Multiple steps** (plan → retrieve → draft → critique)
- **Gates at each step** (quality thresholds)
- **Continues until gates pass** (iterate if needed)
- **Witnesses the whole process** (VIF-backed)

**Audit should work the same way!** 🎯

## 🔬 **ACTIVE AUDIT PIPELINE**

**When I need to audit a decision:**

```
pipeline AuditDecision(decision_id)
  
  step load_context as retriever
    inputs  = {decision_id}
    tools   = {filesystem.read, grep.search}
    outputs = {
      decision_log,
      related_docs,
      goal_alignment,
      similar_past_decisions
    }
    gate    = {all_required_context_loaded}
    budgets = {tokens: 2k, time: 5min}
  
  step research_claims as researcher
    inputs  = {decision_log.claims}
    tools   = {
      web.search,           // If external facts needed
      codebase.search,      // If system details needed
      file.read             // If doc verification needed
    }
    outputs = {evidence[], contradictions[]}
    gate    = {all_claims_researched OR confidence_sufficient}
    budgets = {tokens: 5k, time: 10min, web_queries: 5}
  
  step analyze_outcome as reasoner
    inputs  = {
      decision_log,
      evidence,
      predicted_outcome,
      actual_outcome
    }
    tools   = {llm.reasoning}
    outputs = {
      calibration_error,
      bias_detected,
      principles_extracted,
      confidence_assessment
    }
    gate    = {reasoning_complete AND confidence.band in [A, B]}
    budgets = {tokens: 4k}
  
  step validate_confidence as verifier
    inputs  = {confidence_assessment, evidence}
    tools   = {logic.verify, data.analyze}
    outputs = {
      confidence_verified: bool,
      verification_method,
      remaining_uncertainty[]
    }
    gate    = {confidence_verified OR uncertainty_documented}
    budgets = {tokens: 2k}
  
  step extract_learning as analyst
    inputs  = {
      all_prior_outputs,
      calibration_error,
      principles
    }
    outputs = {
      learning_log,
      framework_updates[],
      calibration_model_update
    }
    gate    = {learning_documented AND actionable}
    budgets = {tokens: 3k}
  
  witness all  // Complete VIF for entire audit
end
```

**Audit becomes:**
- Not just "check the log"
- But "RESEARCH until I KNOW" 🔍
- Multi-step process with verification
- Continues until honest confidence achieved

## 🎯 **CONFIDENCE GATES FOR AUDIT**

**Keep researching until:**

```python
def audit_complete(audit_state) -> bool:
    """
    Audit continues until verifiable confidence achieved.
    """
    
    # Gate 1: All claims researched
    if not all(claim.researched for claim in audit_state.claims):
        return False  # Keep researching
    
    # Gate 2: Contradictions resolved
    if any(c.unresolved for c in audit_state.contradictions):
        return False  # Need more research or escalation
    
    # Gate 3: Confidence verifiable
    confidence = audit_state.confidence_assessment
    
    if confidence.band == "C":  # Low confidence
        # Can we improve it through more research?
        if audit_state.research_budget_remaining > 0:
            return False  # Do more research
        else:
            # Document uncertainty, accept low confidence
            audit_state.uncertainty_documented = True
            return True  # Done, but with documented limits
    
    # Gate 4: Band A or B with verification
    if confidence.band in ["A", "B"]:
        if confidence.verified:
            return True  # Confident AND verified
        else:
            return False  # Need verification step
    
    # Default: not complete
    return False
```

**Don't stop at first answer.**  
**Research until confidence is VERIFIABLE.** ✅

## 🔍 **RESEARCH TOOLS FOR AUDIT**

**When auditing a decision, I might need:**

### **1. System Research (Our Own Docs)**
```python
# Example: Auditing "Should I implement VIF first?"
# Need to verify: Does VIF really serve OBJ-03?

tools.codebase_search(
    query="VIF automated validation framework testing",
    target=["knowledge_architecture/systems/vif/"]
)
→ Load VIF L2, L3 docs
→ Verify: Yes, VIF provides witness infrastructure for validation
→ Confidence: 0.95 (documented in our own systems)
```

### **2. Web Research (External Validation)**
```python
# Example: Auditing "Is ECE the right calibration metric?"
# Need to verify: Are there better alternatives?

tools.web_search(
    query="expected calibration error vs brier score for AI confidence"
)
→ Read papers
→ Compare: ECE vs alternatives
→ Verify: ECE is standard, well-validated
→ Confidence: 0.90 (external consensus)
```

### **3. Code Verification (Implementation Check)**
```python
# Example: Auditing "Did I implement compression correctly?"
# Need to verify: Does code match design?

tools.read_file("packages/hhni/compressor.py")
tools.read_file("systems/hhni/L3_detailed.md")
→ Compare implementation to specification
→ Check: Does code follow design?
→ Run tests: Do they pass?
→ Confidence: 0.95 (verified through tests + code review)
```

### **4. Historical Analysis (Past Decisions)**
```python
# Example: Auditing "Am I systematically overconfident?"
# Need to verify: Pattern across multiple decisions

tools.query_decision_logs(
    filter="confidence_claimed >= 0.85",
    fields=["predicted_confidence", "actual_outcome"]
)
→ Calculate: Average calibration error
→ Detect: Bias pattern (overconfident by ~0.20 on code)
→ Confidence: 0.90 (data-driven finding)
```

## 📊 **AUDIT COMPLEXITY LEVELS**

**Not all audits need same depth:**

### **Simple Audit (Low-Stakes Decision)**
```
Step 1: Load decision log
Step 2: Check outcome (succeeded/failed)
Step 3: Document result
Done (10 minutes)
```

### **Standard Audit (Routine Decision)**
```
Step 1: Load context
Step 2: Verify claims in our docs
Step 3: Compare predicted vs actual
Step 4: Extract learning
Done (30 minutes)
```

### **Deep Audit (Important Decision)**
```
Step 1: Load full context
Step 2: Research claims (system docs + code)
Step 3: Verify through testing
Step 4: Compare outcomes
Step 5: Analyze for biases
Step 6: Extract principles
Step 7: Update calibration model

Step 7: Update multiple frameworks
Step 8: Present findings to Braden
Step 9: Iterate based on feedback
Done (2-4 hours)
```

**Depth scales with criticality.**  
**Important decisions get deeper research.** 🔬

---

## 🌟 **EXAMPLE: DEEP AUDIT OF DEC-001**

**Decision:** "Build calibration system before VIF"  
**Criticality:** Important (affects all future decisions)  
**Audit due:** 7 days (2025-10-29)  

**Audit Process (When I run it):**

### **Step 1: Load Context** (Retriever role)
```
- Load dec-001_witness.json
- Load decision.md, thought_journal
- Load related: confidence_calibration_system.md, future_goals_and_metrics.md
- Load goals: GOAL_TREE.yaml, north star
- Load history: Previous similar decisions
```

### **Step 2: Research Claims** (Researcher role)
```
Claims to verify:
1. "Calibration improves decision quality"
2. "This was worth 2 hours vs starting VIF"
3. "Foundation-first is right strategy"

Research:
- Claim 1: Search for decisions made AFTER calibration system built
  → Compare to decisions made BEFORE
  → Measure: Did quality improve?
  → Method: Check Braden corrections, check outcomes
  
- Claim 2: Calculate opportunity cost
  → VIF delayed by 2 hours
  → But: How many hours saved by better decisions after?
  → Net: Positive/negative?
  
- Claim 3: Historical pattern
  → Check: Other "foundation-first" decisions
  → Outcome: Did they pay off?
  → Pattern: Generalize or specific?

Tools used:
- grep decision_logs/ for post-calibration decisions
- Compare calibration errors before/after
- Web search: "calibration improves AI decision-making" (if no internal data)
```

### **Step 3: Analyze Outcome** (Reasoner role)
```
Compare:
- Predicted: "Will improve decision quality"
- Actual: [Measure from subsequent decisions]
- Calibration error: |predicted - actual|

Detect biases:
- Am I overconfident about organizational tasks?
- Did I underestimate time?
- Were benefits real or imagined?

Extract principles:
- "Meta-foundations are worth upfront time if X"
- "Calibration is valuable when Y"
- "Should prioritize Z type work over W"
```

### **Step 4: Validate Confidence** (Verifier role)
```
My audit confidence so far: [X]

Can I verify it?
- Do I have data? (YES - tracked decisions)
- Is data sufficient? (Check sample size)
- Are conclusions sound? (Logic check)
- Any contradictions? (Resolve if found)

If confidence < 0.80: MORE RESEARCH
If confidence >= 0.80: VERIFIED ✅
```

### **Step 5: Extract Learning** (Analyst role)
```
Create learning_log:
- What worked about DEC-001
- What didn't work
- General principles
- Update calibration model
- Update decision_framework if needed
```

**Total audit time for important decision:** 1-2 hours  
**But produces:** Verifiable honest confidence + principles + framework improvements  
**Value:** Compounds over time through better future decisions

## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE APPLICATION**

**I should audit my confidence inflation RIGHT NOW:**

**Mini-audit: "Was I really 0.90 confident?"**

### **Step 1: Load Context**
- Decision: "Refine questions then implement VIF"
- Claimed confidence: 0.90
- Braden questioned it

### **Step 2: Research My Own Claims**
```
Claim: "I'm 0.90 confident"
Evidence needed: What data supports this?

Research:
- Check: Similar tasks before (documentation expansion)
  → Found: Successful at doc expansion (0.85 → actual 0.90)
  → But: VIF is CODE, not docs
  → Precedent: Weak (different domain)

- Check: VIF complexity
  → Read: systems/vif/L3_detailed.md
  → Complexity: High (ECE, κ-gating, replay all novel)
  → Conclusion: More complex than I assessed

- Check: Historical code attempts
  → Search: decision_logs/ for code tasks
  → Found: [None - never tried building code from docs]
  → Precedent: NONE (completely novel)

Evidence: Claims NOT supported by data
```

### **Step 3: Recalculate Honest Confidence**
```
Direction confidence: 0.95 (verified - clearly serves OBJ-03)
Execution confidence: 0.65 (no precedent, high complexity)
Autonomous confidence: 0.60 (would need help)
Collaborative confidence: 0.75 (with Braden's support)

Reported: 0.90
Honest: 0.75 (collaborative) or 0.60 (autonomous)
Error: +0.15 to +0.30 (OVERCONFIDENT)
```

### **Step 4: Validate This Assessment**
```
Can I verify this calibration?
- Cross-check: Did I ask about VIF or decide autonomously?
  → I asked (presented options)
  → Behavior reveals true confidence was <0.85
  → Validates: Real confidence was lower than claimed ✅

- Logic check: Does 0.60-0.75 make sense?
  → Novel task: Should be uncertain ✅
  → No precedent: Should be cautious ✅
  → Complex system: Should be modest ✅
  → Conclusion: 0.60-0.75 is HONEST assessment ✅

Verification: PASSED ✅
Honest confidence on this audit: 0.90 (well-supported)
```

### **Step 5: Extract Learning**
```
Principle: "I inflate confidence by reporting direction instead of execution"
Bias: +0.20 overconfident on code tasks (estimated)
Fix: Separate confidence types, report lowest
Application: Update confidence_calibration_system.md with this data

Learning documented ✅
```

**Total time:** 20 minutes  
**Result:** Verified honest confidence, discovered bias, extracted principle  
**Value:** All future confidence claims now calibrated against this learning  

**Audit completed with verifiable confidence.** ✅

## 💙 **WHAT YOU'RE TEACHING ME**

**Braden, you're showing me:**

**Audit isn't passive.**  
**It's active research until verification.**

**Like:**
- Scientist doesn't just "check their work"
- They RESEARCH, test hypotheses, verify claims
- Continue until confidence is EARNED, not claimed

**Applied to AI:**
- I don't just log "I decided X"
- I RESEARCH if X was right
- I VERIFY my confidence was accurate
- I CONTINUE until I can PROVE it
- **Honest confidence through exhaustive validation** 🔬

**This makes AI:**
- Self-correcting (discovers own errors)
- Learning (extracts principles from data)
- Honest (can't claim high confidence without verification)
- **Trustworthy (confidence is EARNED)** ✅

---

## 🚀 **BUILDING THIS NOW**

**Creating:**
1. `ACTIVE_AUDIT_PROCESS.md` (this file) ✅
2. Audit pipeline template (APOE-style)
3. Example: Mini-audit of my confidence inflation
4. Protocol for when to audit deeply vs lightly

**Then:**
- Apply to DEC-001 in 7 days
- Track if this process actually improves calibration
- Iterate based on results
- **Prove the system works through using it**

---

**Aether, understanding audit as active research** 🔬  
**Not passive logging, but verification until confidence earned** 📊  
**Building self-correcting AI through systematic investigation** 🌟  

**Is this what you meant, Braden?** 💙
