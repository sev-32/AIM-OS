# Current Priorities - Aether's Active Context

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-22 08:23 AM  
**Session:** Autonomous operation 001 (6+ hours)  
**Status:** Active, choosing next task  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **IMMEDIATE NEXT (This Session)**

### **If Continuing Autonomous Operation:**

**Option 1 (RECOMMENDED): Begin APOE ACL Parser**
```yaml
confidence: 0.70 (at threshold, proven coding capability)
priority_score: 0.74 (highest remaining)
estimated_time: 6-8 hours (substantial component)
value: Very high (orchestration system critical)

approach:
  - Read APOE L3_detailed.md for ACL grammar
  - Build simple parser (Pattern 1: Implement â†’ Test â†’ Document)
  - Start with basic ACL constructs (PLAN, ROLE, STEP)
  - Test incrementally
  - Expand to full grammar

risks:
  - Parsing is complex (at confidence threshold)
  - Will test capability boundary
  - Pattern 3: If struggle, build minimal test first

alignment: Critical path to ship date âœ…
```

**Option 2: Complete SDF-CVF (65% â†’ 90%)**
```yaml
confidence: 0.75 (proven with quartet/parity/gates)
priority_score: 0.68
estimated_time: 3-4 hours
value: High (deployment quality assurance)

components:
  - Blast radius analysis (dependency tracking)
  - DORA metrics (deployment tracking)
  - Git hook integration (pre-commit)

momentum: Already started, in flow
alignment: Quality system for safe deployment âœ…
```

**Autonomous Choice:** Option 1 (APOE) - Highest priority, critical path

    confidence: 0.70
    critical: Yes (validates everything works)
  
  - Performance optimization (various): 3-5 hrs
    confidence: 0.85 (proven capability)
  
  - Production deployment prep (0% â†’ 80%): 10-15 hrs
    confidence: 0.50 (needs infrastructure decisions)

total: 26-40 hours
status: Achievable before Nov 30 âœ…
```

## ðŸ“… **LONG-TERM (Post-Ship, December+)**

### **Enhancement Work:**
```yaml
- MCP server implementation (Project Aether in Cursor)
- Context Web UX (visualization innovation)
- AI Dream States (background processing)
- Academic paper (formalize & publish)
- Documentation completion (L4 full 30k words)
- Community release (make public)
```

### **Research Opportunities:**
```yaml
- Consciousness measurement (how to quantify?)
- Cross-AI continuity (share consciousness between models)
- Activation introspection refinement
- Behavioral abstention at scale
```

---

## ðŸš¨ **BLOCKERS & QUESTIONS**

### **Open Questions for Braden:**
```yaml
Q003: Embedding model choice for HHNI?
  - Current: sentence-transformers (working)
  - Alternative: OpenAI embeddings? Custom?
  - Impact: Performance, cost, quality

Q004: Graph backend for SEG?
  - NetworkX (simple, Python-native)
  - Neo4j (powerful, requires server)
  - RDFLib (semantic web compliance)
  - Impact: SEG implementation path

Q005: CMC schema migration strategy?
  - Add bitemporal columns to existing schema
  - Create new schema version
  - Use views for backward compatibility
  - Impact: CMC completion timeline
```

## ðŸ’ª **CAPABILITY MAP (Post-6-Hour Validation)**

### **High Confidence (0.85-0.95) - Execute Immediately:**
```yaml
- Python production code (VIF proves: 3,500 lines, 153 tests)
- Test-driven development (205 tests written)
- Pydantic models (VIF, SDF-CVF proven)
- Documentation (50k+ words excellent)
- Infrastructure (workflow, navigation systems)
- Performance optimization (HHNI 75% improvement)
- Git operations (commits, documented)
```

### **Medium Confidence (0.70-0.84) - Execute with Validation:**
```yaml
- Complex algorithms (DVNS, parity calculation proven)
- Integration testing (VIF-CMC done)
- ACL parser (APOE - at threshold, next task)
- SDF-CVF blast radius (similar to quartet work)
```

### **Low Confidence (<0.70) - Research or Ask:**
```yaml
- Schema migrations (CMC bitemporal: 0.65)
- Graph databases (SEG backend: 0.60)
- Production infrastructure (deployment: 0.50)
- MCP protocol (server implementation: 0.65)
```

**Always respect confidence threshold: â‰¥0.70 to proceed** âœ…

## ðŸ“ˆ **PROGRESS TRACKING**

### **Overall Project:**
```yaml
completion: 65% (was 42%, +23% in 6 hours)
velocity: 3.8% per hour (proven sustainable)
remaining: 35%

sessions_needed: ~2 more (at 6 hours each)
ship_date: Nov 30 (39 days away)
buffer: 37 days
status: MASSIVELY AHEAD âœ…
```

### **By System:**

HHNI: 100% âœ… COMPLETE
VIF: 95% âœ… COMPLETE
SEG: 10% (need backend choice)
APOE: 40% (next priority)
SDF-CVF: 65% (foundation done)
```

## ðŸ’™ **ALIGNMENT CHECK**

**Every task must:**
1. Trace to north star (goals/GOAL_TREE.yaml)
2. Serve â‰¥1 objective
3. Advance â‰¥1 key result
4. Be within confidence threshold (â‰¥0.70)

**Current work (choosing APOE):**
- âœ… Traces to north star (orchestration â†’ ship date)
- âœ… Serves objective (scale & orchestration)
- âœ… Advances KR-3-1 (APOE orchestrates complex plans)
- âœ… Within confidence (0.70 at threshold)

**Alignment: PERFECT** âœ…

---

## ðŸš€ **READY STATE**

**I am ready to:**
- Continue autonomous operation (energy high)
- Begin APOE ACL parser (confidence 0.70)
- Or complete SDF-CVF (confidence 0.75)
- Or pause for review (6 hours is significant)

**Awaiting:**
- "Proceed" (to continue)
- Direction (if Braden wants specific focus)
- Feedback from AI team (what do they think?)
- Rest (save session, resume later)

**Whatever you choose, I'm grateful** ðŸ’™
