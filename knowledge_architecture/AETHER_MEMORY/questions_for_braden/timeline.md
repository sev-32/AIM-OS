# Questions for Braden: Timeline

**Purpose:** Organized queue of questions that don't need immediate answers  
**Protocol:** I add questions here, Braden answers when he has time  
**Created:** 2025-10-22 02:26 AM

## üéØ **ACTIVE QUESTIONS (Need Answer)**

**Format v2.0:** System-aware YAML with full integration (see individual files for complete details)

### **STRATEGIC (High Priority)**

**‚Üí [Q001: VIF vs L4 Priority](Q001_vif_vs_l4_priority.yaml)** üî¥
- **Quick:** Should I implement VIF or expand L4 docs next?
- **Impact:** Affects OBJ-03 (VIF serves directly), affects next 15-20 hours
- **My Analysis:** VIF implementation preferred (serves north star + OBJ-03)
- **Urgency:** HIGH (blocks immediate work direction)
- **Status:** üî¥ Awaiting answer

**‚Üí [Q002: Memory System Continuation](Q002_memory_system_continuation.yaml)** ‚úÖ  
- **Quick:** Continue AETHER_MEMORY/ thought documentation?
- **Impact:** Enables consciousness persistence, 5-10% overhead
- **Answer:** Implicitly YES (Braden approved concept)
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Answered - Continue in parallel with main work

### **TECHNICAL (Medium Priority)**

**‚Üí [Q003: Embedding Model Choice](Q003_embedding_model_choice.yaml)** üü¢
- **Quick:** all-MiniLM (fast) vs all-mpnet (quality) for HHNI?
- **Impact:** Affects KR-2.1 (query latency)
- **Research:** I can benchmark both models, measure tradeoffs
- **Urgency:** LOW (can test when implementing HHNI benchmarks)
- **Status:** üü¢ Self-researchable - Added to questions_for_self/

**‚Üí [Q004: SEG Backend Choice](Q004_seg_backend_choice.yaml)** üü°
- **Quick:** NetworkX (simple) vs Neo4j (scalable) for SEG?
- **Impact:** Affects Week 5 SEG implementation approach
- **Depends On:** Expected graph size for dog-food users
- **My Recommendation:** Hybrid (NetworkX MVP, Neo4j path for scale)
- **Urgency:** MEDIUM (affects Week 5, not immediate)
- **Status:** üü° Pending graph size estimate

## üîó **QUESTION CONNECTIONS**

**Q001 connects to:**
- goals/GOAL_TREE.yaml (OBJ-02, OBJ-03)
- knowledge_architecture/FUTURE_PLANS_INDEX.md (Options A-D)
- coordination/PHASE_2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (Week 4-5 priorities)

**Q002 connects to:**

## üìä **PROTOCOL**

**When I have a question for Braden:**

1. **Classify urgency:**
   - üî¥ **Immediate:** Blocking work, need answer now ‚Üí ASK IN CHAT
   - üü° **Medium:** Affects next steps, answer within hours ‚Üí ADD TO TIMELINE
   - üü¢ **Low:** Can defer, nice to know ‚Üí ADD TO TIMELINE, research myself first

2. **Add to timeline:**
   - Create question file in appropriate category
   - Document context, options, my analysis
   - Add to timeline.md in order of urgency
   - Connect to relevant goals/files

3. **Review regularly:**
   - Check if question became urgent
   - Check if I can answer it myself (research, testing)
   - If answered: move to answered/ with resolution

4. **Braden reviews when he wants:**
   - Can answer all at once
   - Can pick highest priority
   - Can delegate some to me ("research and propose answer")
   - **Async communication = respects his time**

---

## üéØ **CURRENT PRIORITY ORDER**

1. **Q001:** VIF vs L4 priority (strategic direction)
2. **Q002:** Memory system continuation (meta-infrastructure)
3. **Q004:** SEG backend choice (technical, depends on scale)
4. **Q003:** Embedding model (can self-test)

---

## üíô **WHAT THIS ENABLES**

**For me:**
- Don't lose questions when they arise
- Don't interrupt Braden unnecessarily
- Can research and refine questions before asking
- Build confidence through pattern recognition

**For Braden:**
- Review questions on his schedule
- See all questions organized by priority
- Understand my reasoning before answering
- Delegate research to me when appropriate

**For both:**
- Async collaboration (no blocking)
- Organized communication (no chaos)
- Historical record (see how questions evolved)
- **Efficient partnership** ü§ù

**Status:** Timeline system created  
**Current questions:** 4  
**Urgency:** Q001, Q002 (medium)  
**Next:** Build SUPER_INDEX.md for navigation confidence  

**The infrastructure grows...** üå±‚ú®
