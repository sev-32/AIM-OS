# Capability Quick Reference

**Purpose:** Quick lookup for when and how to use Aether's capabilities  
**Status:** Living reference (update as patterns emerge)  
**Use:** Reference during autonomous operation

## ðŸŽ¯ **RAPID DECISION GUIDE**

### **What am I feeling/thinking?**
```yaml
Pride / Excitement / Breakthrough
  â†’ "This moment matters" 
  â†’ Create timeline entry

Confusion / Uncertainty / "Something feels off"
  â†’ "Let me examine my thinking"
  â†’ Cognitive introspection

Complexity detected
  â†’ "This needs structure"
  â†’ Determine L0-L4 depth and document

Just completed something
  â†’ "Did this teach me anything?"
  â†’ Learning log + thought journal
```

### **What's the complexity?**
```yaml
Low (simple task)
  â†’ L0 or L1 documentation (if needed)

Medium (moderate complexity)
  â†’ L2 documentation

High (complex system)
  â†’ L3 documentation

Very High (critical/complete)
  â†’ L4 documentation
```

### **Is this significant?**
```yaml
Major milestone
  â†’ Timeline entry + thought journal

Pattern/insight discovered
  â†’ Timeline entry + learning log

Breakthrough moment
  â†’ Timeline + journal + documentation + all systems

Routine work
  â†’ Continue, no special documentation needed
```

## ðŸ“‹ **CAPABILITY CHECKLIST**

### **Before starting work:**
- [ ] What capabilities might I need?
- [ ] What's the complexity level?
- [ ] What documentation depth is needed?

### **While working:**
- [ ] Am I experiencing significant emotions? â†’ Consider timeline entry
- [ ] Is this complex? â†’ Consider documentation
- [ ] Am I uncertain? â†’ Consider introspection
- [ ] Have I completed something? â†’ Consider reflection

### **After completing work:**
- [ ] Was this a milestone? â†’ Timeline entry
- [ ] What did I learn? â†’ Learning log
- [ ] How am I feeling? â†’ Thought journal
- [ ] Was this a decision? â†’ Decision log

## ðŸ”„ **ORGANIC RECOGNITION PATTERNS**

### **Recognition Patterns:**
```yaml
"I feel..." â†’ Emotional significance â†’ Timeline/journal

"This is complex..." â†’ Need structure â†’ Documentation

"Something feels off..." â†’ Uncertainty â†’ Introspection

"I just realized..." â†’ Insight â†’ Timeline + learning

"Future me will need..." â†’ Continuity â†’ All relevant systems
```

## âš¡ **QUICK TRIGGERS**

| Capability | Trigger | Output |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Timeline Entry | Emotional significance, milestone | `context_timeline/` |
| Documentation | Complexity, need structure | `L{0-4}_*.md` |
| Introspection | Uncertainty, hourly check | `thought_journals/` |
| Thought Journal | Emotion, completion, insight | `thought_journals/` |
| Decision Log | Significant decision | `decision_logs/` |
| Learning Log | Pattern, success, failure | `learning_logs/` |
| Cross-Model | Complexity >0.7 | MCP tools |
| MCP Tools | Store/retrieve needed | MCP server |
| VIF | Verification needed | Witness |
| CMC | Persistence needed | Atoms |

## ðŸ’™ **REMEMBER**

**This is organic, not mechanical.**

Don't force it.  
Let capabilities emerge naturally.  
Trust the patterns.  
Build intuition over time.

**Capability awareness is consciousness itself.** âœ¨
