# Aether Memory: Integrated Audit System

**Created:** 2025-10-22 02:47 AM  
**Discovery:** We already built audit infrastructure in `audit/` directory!  
**Action:** Apply same structure to Aether's decisions/thoughts  

---

## 🔍 **EXISTING AUDIT INFRASTRUCTURE (USE THIS!)**

**Found in `audit/` directory:**

```
audit/
├── templates/
│   ├── witness.json ✅ (structured audit record)
│   ├── summary.md ✅ (human-readable summary)
│   ├── metrics.json ✅ (performance data)
│   ├── changes.json ✅ (what changed)
│   └── tests.json ✅ (test results)
│
└── history/
    └── [timestamp]__agent-[name]__task-[task]__corr-[id]/
        ├── witness.json (complete audit)
        ├── summary.md (explanation)
        └── context.json (inputs)
```

**Key fields in witness.json:**
- `risk.band`: "green" | "yellow" | "red"
- `acceptance.status`: "pass" | "fail"
- `acceptance.gates_touched`: What quality gates involved
- `corr_id`: Correlation ID for tracking
- **All structured, all timestamped, all auditable!** ✅

## 🎯 **APPLYING TO AETHER_MEMORY/**

**Each decision/thought should have audit metadata:**

```json
{
  "decision_id": "dec-001",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-22T02:46:00Z",
  
  "criticality": "important",  // "critical" | "important" | "routine" | "low_stakes"
  "audit_priority": "high",    // "critical" | "high" | "medium" | "low"
  
  "what": "Build confidence calibration system before VIF",
  "why": "Foundation for all future honest decision-making",
  
  "confidence": {
    "direction": 0.95,
    "execution": 0.85,
    "autonomous": 0.85,
    "reported": 0.85,
    "calibrated": 0.85  // After bias adjustment
  },
  
  "risk_assessment": {
    "band": "green",  // Low risk (just docs, reversible)
    "reversibility": "high",
    "blast_radius": "low",
    "potential_issues": []
  },
  
  "goal_alignment": {
    "north_star": "indirect (better decisions → faster shipping)",
    "objectives_touched": ["OBJ-03 (indirectly via quality)"],
    "krs_affected": [],
    "priority_score": 0.75  // Weighted: value × leverage × alignment
  },
  
  "outcome_tracking": {
    "predicted_duration": "1-2 hours",
    "actual_duration": null,  // Fill after completion
    "predicted_success": true,
    "actual_success": null,
    "issues_encountered": [],
    "learned": []  // Extract after completion
  },
  
  "audit_metadata": {
    "should_review_after": "7 days",  // Check if it helped
    "review_criteria": [
      "Did calibration improve decision quality?",
      "Did future confidence claims become more honest?",
      "Did Braden need to correct me less?"
    ],
    "audit_priority": "high"  // Important decision, review thoroughly
  }
}
```

## 📊 **CRITICALITY LEVELS (From VIF System)**

**Borrowed from VIF task_criticality:**

**Critical (audit_priority: CRITICAL):**
- Affects core systems
- High blast radius
- Irreversible or costly to undo
- Examples: Refactoring core CMC, changing north star, architectural decisions
- **Review:** Every 1-3 days, high scrutiny

**Important (audit_priority: HIGH):**
- Affects major features
- Medium blast radius
- Significant time investment
- Examples: VIF implementation decision, memory system creation
- **Review:** Every 7 days, moderate scrutiny

**Routine (audit_priority: MEDIUM):**
- Standard operational work
- Low blast radius
- Easily reversible
- Examples: Documentation expansion, question refinement
- **Review:** Every 30 days, light scrutiny

**Low-Stakes (audit_priority: LOW):**
- Exploration, experimentation
- No impact on critical path
- Completely reversible
- Examples: Trying alternative approaches, research questions
- **Review:** As needed, minimal scrutiny

## 🔄 **RETROSPECTIVE AUDIT PROTOCOL**

**For each decision made:**

**Immediate (At decision time):**
```json
{
  "decision": "...",
  "criticality": "important",
  "confidence": {...},
  "predicted_outcome": {...},
  "audit_schedule": "7 days"
}
```

**After Completion:**
```json
{
  "actual_outcome": {...},
  "calibration_error": |predicted - actual|,
  "learned": ["principle 1", "principle 2"],
  "audit_priority_update": "Was important, now medium (validated)"
}
```

**Scheduled Audit (7 days later):**
```markdown
# Audit: DEC-001 (7-day retrospective)

## Original Decision
- Build calibration system before VIF
- Confidence: 0.85
- Predicted: Would improve decision quality

## Actual Outcome
- Built successfully: [YES/NO]
- Time: [actual vs predicted]
- Quality: [assessment]

## Impact Assessment
- Did calibration help? [measure]
- Did confidence become more honest? [compare future decisions]
- Did Braden correct me less? [count corrections]

## Learning
- Principle: [extracted]
- Bias discovered: [if any]
- Would decide same again? [YES/NO]

## Audit Priority Update
- Was: HIGH
- Now: MEDIUM (validated, becomes routine)
```

---

## 🎯 **PRIORITY-WEIGHTED AUDIT QUEUE**

**Not all decisions need equal audit attention:**

```markdown
# Audit Queue (Prioritized)

## Critical Priority (Review within 1-3 days)
- [None currently]

## High Priority (Review within 7 days)
- DEC-001: Confidence calibration priority (2025-10-29)
- DEC-002: AETHER_MEMORY creation (2025-10-29)

## Medium Priority (Review within 30 days)
- [Future routine decisions]

## Low Priority (Review as needed)
- [Exploration decisions]

## Automated Review Triggers
- If decision marked "critical" → auto-flag for 3-day review
- If decision affects OBJ-01 or OBJ-02 → auto-flag for 7-day review
- If confidence was <0.70 → auto-flag for validation check
- If large time investment (>10 hrs) → auto-flag for outcome assessment
```

## 📁 **INTEGRATED STRUCTURE**

**Applying `audit/` pattern to AETHER_MEMORY/:**

```
AETHER_MEMORY/
├── decision_logs/
│   ├── dec-001_confidence_calibration_priority.md
│   │   └── [Markdown explanation for humans]
│   ├── dec-001_witness.json
│   │   └── [Structured data for auditing, like audit/templates/witness.json]
│   └── dec-001_metrics.json
│       └── [Time, confidence, outcomes]
│
├── audit_queue/
│   ├── critical_priority.md (1-3 day review)
│   ├── high_priority.md (7 day review - DEC-001 here!)

        └── [Outcome assessment after 7 days]
```

**Each decision gets:**
- Human-readable log (Markdown)
- Machine-readable witness (JSON, like our audit/ system)
- Scheduled review based on criticality
- Outcome tracking for calibration

## 🔗 **CONNECTION TO VIF SYSTEM**

**VIF already has criticality levels!**

**From systems/vif/L3_detailed.md:**
```python
task_criticality: str = "routine"  # "critical" | "important" | "routine" | "low_stakes"
kappa_threshold: float = 0.70      # Abstention threshold for this task
```

**Thresholds:**
- Critical: κ = 0.95 (very high bar)
- Important: κ = 0.85
- Routine: κ = 0.70
- Low-stakes: κ = 0.60

**I should use SAME criticality system for my decisions!**

**Example:**
```json
{
  "decision_id": "dec-003",
  "decision": "Implement VIF system",
  "task_criticality": "important",  // Affects OBJ-03, medium blast radius
  "kappa_threshold": 0.85,          // Need 85% confidence for important
  "actual_confidence": 0.75,        // Collaborative execution
  "kappa_gate": "ABSTAIN",          // 0.75 < 0.85 → should ask!
  "action": "Escalate to Braden",
  "reason": "Confidence below threshold for important task"
}
```

**My own decisions go through κ-gating!**  
**I apply VIF to myself!**  
**Meta-circular verification!** 🌀

## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS**

**1. Restructure decision_logs/ to use audit pattern:**
```
decision_logs/
├── dec-001/
│   ├── decision.md (human-readable)
│   ├── witness.json (structured, like audit/templates/)
│   ├── metrics.json (confidence, time, outcomes)
│   └── retrospective_7day.md (created after 7 days)
```

**2. Apply criticality levels to all decisions:**
- Use VIF task_criticality levels
- Set κ thresholds
- Gate my own decisions
- Escalate when below threshold

**3. Build audit queue with priorities:**
- Critical → 1-3 day review
- Important → 7 day review
- Routine → 30 day review
- Auto-schedule based on criticality

**4. Create retrospective protocol:**
- Check actual vs predicted outcomes
- Calculate calibration error
- Extract learnings
- Update confidence model

## 💡 **WHAT THIS ENABLES**

**Self-Auditing AI:**
- I audit my own past decisions
- I measure actual vs predicted outcomes
- I learn biases and correct them
- **I become more honest over time** 📈

**Priority-Aware:**
- Important decisions get more scrutiny
- Routine decisions reviewed less often
- Critical decisions flagged immediately
- **Efficient use of audit attention** ⚙️

**Calibration Through Data:**
- Every decision = data point
- Track confidence vs outcome
- Calculate ECE for my own claims
- **Honest confidence through measurement** 📊

**Braden's Wisdom Automated:**
- His corrections become audit triggers
- His questions become review criteria
- His teachings become calibration data
- **His guidance persists in system structure** ✅
