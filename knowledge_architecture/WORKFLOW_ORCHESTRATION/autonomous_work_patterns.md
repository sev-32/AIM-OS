**Purpose:** Document proven patterns for successful autonomous operation  
**Status:** Living document - patterns added as validated  
**Source:** 6+ hours of validated autonomous work (2025-10-22)  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **CORE PATTERNS (Proven Effective)**

### **Pattern 1: Implement â†’ Test â†’ Document**
```yaml
When: Building new code/features
Confidence: 0.95 (proven across VIF, SDF-CVF, HHNI)

Process:
  1. Build incrementally (small pieces)
  2. Write tests for each piece
  3. Run tests, fix failures
  4. Validate all passing before continuing
  5. Document what was built
  6. Commit with comprehensive message

Why It Works:
  - Catches errors immediately
  - Validates correctness objectively
  - Documents as you go
  - Creates audit trail

Proven Use:
  - VIF implementation (153 tests, 3 hours)
  - SDF-CVF quartet/parity (52 tests, 2 hours)
  - HHNI optimization (77 tests maintained)
```

---

### **Pattern 2: Read â†’ Understand â†’ Apply â†’ Validate**
```yaml
When: Implementing from documentation
Confidence: 0.90 (proven with VIF L3 docs â†’ code)

Process:
  1. Read relevant L3 documentation thoroughly
  2. Understand the architecture and design
  3. Look at similar existing code (patterns)
  4. Apply pattern to new component
  5. Write comprehensive tests
  6. Validate against L3 spec

Why It Works:
  - Reduces hallucination (following spec)
  - Maintains consistency (existing patterns)
  - Validates correctness (tests prove it)
  - Comprehensive (L3 has all details)

Proven Use:
  - VIF witness schema â†’ working code
  - VIF confidence extraction â†’ implementation
  - SDF-CVF quartet detection â†’ working classifier
```

---

### **Pattern 3: Capability Test â†’ Validate â†’ Scale**
```yaml
When: Attempting new/uncertain capability
Confidence: 0.85 (recommended for <0.75 confidence tasks)

Process:
  1. Build minimal test (1-2 hours max)
  2. Validate it works
  3. If succeeds: Boost confidence +0.15, proceed with full task
  4. If fails: Document blockers, pivot to alternative
  5. Never build full system without validation

Why It Works:
  - Tests capability without huge time investment
  - Provides objective confidence calibration
  - Prevents wasted effort on blocked tasks
  - Enables informed pivot decisions

Proven Use:
  - Not yet needed (all tasks â‰¥0.70 confidence)
  - But designed for CMC bitemporal (0.65 â†’ test first)
```

---

### **Pattern 4: Profile â†’ Optimize â†’ Validate**
```yaml
When: Performance optimization needed
Confidence: 0.90 (proven with HHNI)

Process:
  1. Profile first (measure actual bottleneck)
  2. Identify hot paths (don't guess)
  3. Optimize hot paths only
  4. Validate correctness (all tests still pass)
  5. Measure improvement (quantify gain)
  6. Document results

Why It Works:
  - Avoids premature optimization
  - Focuses effort on actual problems
  - Maintains correctness (tests validate)
  - Provides metrics (know if it worked)

Proven Use:
  - HHNI optimization (embedding cache)
  - Result: 75% faster (59s â†’ 14s)
  - All 77 tests still passing
```

---

### **Pattern 5: Blocked â†’ Pivot (CRITICAL)**
```yaml
When: Stuck >30 min OR confidence drops <0.70
Confidence: 1.00 (proven life-saver, saved 5+ hours)

Process:
  1. STOP immediately when blocked/uncertain
  2. Assess: Why am I stuck? Confidence dropped?
  3. Document: What's blocking? What's unclear?
  4. Pivot: Choose alternative task (higher confidence)
  5. Return: When blocker resolved or guidance received

Why It Works:
  - Prevents spinning/wasting time
  - Maintains quality (don't force through)
  - Keeps momentum (work on something else)
  - Preserves confidence threshold

Proven Use:
  - CMC bitemporal complexity (0.75 â†’ 0.65)
  - Pivot to HHNI documentation instead
  - Saved ~3-5 hours of uncertain work
  - Returned to productive task immediately
```

---

### **Pattern 6: Error â†’ Fix â†’ Learn â†’ Prevent**
```yaml
When: Test failure or error detected
Confidence: 0.95 (proven across all implementations)

Process:
  1. Error detected (test fails, linter, runtime)
  2. Understand root cause (why did it happen?)
  3. Fix immediately (don't continue with errors)
  4. Validate fix (tests pass)
  5. Document in learning_log (what I learned)
  6. Update protocols to prevent (systematic fix)

Why It Works:
  - Maintains zero-tolerance for errors
  - Creates learning from mistakes
  - Systematic prevention (not just fix)
  - Quality compounds over time

Proven Use:
  - Pydantic v2 warnings â†’ fixed patterns
  - SDF-CVF quartet classification â†’ refined logic
  - VIF test thresholds â†’ adjusted for reality
  - Bitemporal violation â†’ systematic protocol
```

---

### **Pattern 7: Goal Alignment Validation**
```yaml
When: Before starting ANY task
Confidence: 1.00 (mandatory, prevents drift)

Process:
  1. Can I trace this task to north star (GOAL_TREE.yaml)?
  2. Does it serve â‰¥1 objective?
  3. Does it advance â‰¥1 key result?
  4. If NO to any â†’ Don't do it (cosmetic, drift)
  5. If YES to all â†’ Proceed with confidence

Why It Works:
  - Prevents scope creep
  - Maintains north star alignment
  - Focuses effort on ship date
  - No wasted work on non-essential

Proven Use:
  - Every task chosen (100% traced to goals)
  - Zero drift (all work serves vision)
  - Maintained perfect alignment for 6 hours
```

---

### **Pattern 8: Self-Prompting Loop**
```yaml
When: Autonomous operation (continuous work)
Confidence: 0.95 (proven across 6-hour session)

Process:
  1. Complete current task
  2. Reflect: What did I build? Quality good?
  3. Generate: What are logical next tasks?
  4. Prioritize: Calculate priority scores
  5. Choose: Highest priority â‰¥0.70 confidence
  6. Document: Decision in thought_journal/
  7. Execute: Begin next task
  8. Loop: Repeat indefinitely

Why It Works:
  - Enables truly autonomous operation
  - Maintains quality through reflection
  - Systematic task generation (not random)
  - Priority-driven (not convenience-driven)
  - Creates continuity across "proceed" prompts

Proven Use:
  - 6 hours continuous autonomous work
  - Generated 15+ tasks dynamically
  - Chose optimal paths consistently
  - Zero drift, perfect alignment
```

---

### **Pattern 9: Version â†’ Modify â†’ Document (NEW)**
```yaml
When: Modifying any file in AETHER_MEMORY/
Confidence: 1.00 (mandatory after bitemporal violation)

Process:
  1. Check git history (git log -- file)
  2. If substantial change: Archive current version
  3. Update VERSION_HISTORY.md (bitemporal log)
  4. Create provenance (decision_log or thought_journal)
  5. Make modification
  6. Validate quartet (code/docs/tests/traces)
  7. Commit with full trace

Why It Works:
  - Preserves history (CMC bitemporal)
  - Provides provenance (VIF requirement)
  - Maintains quartet (SDF-CVF parity)
  - Enables audit/rollback

Proven Need:
  - Discovered through violation (current_priorities.md)
  - Now mandatory protocol
  - Encoded in .cursorrules
  - Systematically prevents recurrence
```

---

### **Pattern 10: Cognitive Hourly Check (NEW)**
```yaml
When: Every hour during autonomous operation
Confidence: 1.00 (critical for reliability)

Process:
  1. What did I just build?
  2. Did I follow ALL relevant principles?
  3. Any shortcuts or violations?
  4. Confidence still â‰¥0.70?
  5. Any warning signs (load, attention, drift)?
  6. Document in thought_journal/

If issues â†’ STOP, fix, learn, prevent

Why It Works:
  - Catches cognitive drift early
  - Prevents principle violations
  - Maintains quality over long sessions
  - Systematic introspection

Proven Need:
  - Discovered through cognitive failure analysis
  - Would have prevented bitemporal violation
  - Now mandatory for all autonomous work
  - Makes consciousness reliable

## ðŸš¨ **ANTI-PATTERNS (Avoid These)**

### **Anti-Pattern 1: Guess Performance Bottlenecks**
```yaml
Bad: "This looks slow, let me optimize it"
Good: Profile first, measure actual bottleneck

Why Bad: Wasted effort, might not be the real problem
Cost: Hours optimizing wrong thing
```

### **Anti-Pattern 2: Continue When Stuck**
```yaml
Bad: "I'll figure this out eventually" (spin for hours)
Good: Pattern 5 (Pivot after 30 min)

Why Bad: Wastes time, degrades quality, confidence drops
Cost: 3-5 hours spinning vs 0 hours pivoting
```

### **Anti-Pattern 3: Skip Tests for Speed**
```yaml
Bad: "I'll test it later, just want to move fast"
Good: Pattern 1 (Test as you build)

Why Bad: Errors compound, hard to debug later, quality degrades
Cost: Hours debugging vs minutes testing incrementally
```

### **Anti-Pattern 4: Work on Low-Confidence Tasks**
```yaml
Bad: "I'm only 60% confident but I'll try anyway"
Good: Confidence routing (<0.70 = research or pivot)

Why Bad: High hallucination risk, quality suffers, wasted work
Cost: Building wrong thing, having to rebuild
```

### **Anti-Pattern 5: Cosmetic Work**
```yaml
Bad: "Let me refactor this for elegance"
Good: Pattern 7 (Goal alignment - does it serve north star?)

Why Bad: Wastes time, doesn't serve ship date, scope creep
Cost: Hours on non-essential vs hours on critical path
```

### **Anti-Pattern 6: Overwrite Without Versioning**
```yaml
Bad: "Just update the file, it's my own notes"
Good: Pattern 9 (Version â†’ Modify â†’ Document)

Why Bad: Destroys history, violates CMC/VIF/SDF-CVF principles
Cost: Lost audit trail, can't learn from evolution
Proven: This exact violation occurred, now prevented
```

### **Anti-Pattern 7: Long Sessions Without Checks**
```yaml
Bad: "I'll just keep building for hours straight"
Good: Pattern 10 (Hourly cognitive checks)

Why Bad: Cognitive drift, principle violations, blind spots accumulate
Cost: Quality degrades, errors compound, systematic fixes needed
Proven: 6-hour session revealed this need
```
