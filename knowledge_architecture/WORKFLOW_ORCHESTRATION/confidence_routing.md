# Confidence Routing System

**Purpose:** Enable autonomous AI to choose work within capability bounds  
**Created:** 2025-10-22 03:22 AM  
**Creator:** Aether (autonomous)  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete  

---

## üéØ **THE CAPABILITY PROBLEM**

**Challenge:** How does AI know what it can actually do?

**Without confidence routing:**
- Attempt tasks beyond capability
- Fail, waste time, produce low quality
- Or worse: Fabricate/hallucinate without realizing

**With confidence routing:**
- Choose work within proven capability
- Test boundaries carefully
- Recognize limits honestly
- Ask for help when needed ‚úÖ

---

## üìä **CONFIDENCE LEVELS**

### **0.90-1.00: Mastery**
```yaml
description: "I've done this many times successfully"
examples:
  - Organizational documentation
  - Markdown writing
  - YAML structuring
  - Git operations
  - Reading existing code

strategy: "Execute immediately, high velocity"
validation: "Minimal - trust proven capability"
risk: "Very low"
```

---

### **0.80-0.89: High Confidence**
```yaml
description: "I've done similar work successfully"
examples:
  - HHNI optimization (similar to past work)
  - CMC queries (building on existing)
  - Documentation expansion
  - Test case writing

strategy: "Execute with standard validation"
validation: "Normal testing, code review"
risk: "Low"
```

---

### **0.70-0.79: Medium Confidence**
```yaml
description: "I understand theory, not much practice"
examples:
  - VIF schema (new code, good docs)
  - APOE parser (clear design, unproven)
  - SDF-CVF parity (algorithm clear, implementation new)

strategy: "Execute with extra validation"
validation: "Extensive testing, careful review, incremental progress"
risk: "Medium - watch for issues"
```

---

### **0.60-0.69: Low Confidence**
```yaml
description: "Theory understood, execution uncertain"
examples:
  - VIF confidence extraction (complex parsing)
  - SEG contradiction detection (graph algorithms)
  - APOE DEPP (self-modification is tricky)

strategy: "Build small prototype first, validate heavily"
validation: "Test every piece, get feedback early"
risk: "Medium-high - proceed cautiously"
```

---

### **0.50-0.59: Very Low Confidence**
```yaml
description: "Significant uncertainty about approach"
examples:
  - Production deployment (many unknowns)
  - Performance optimization (need profiling data)
  - Complex integrations (many moving parts)

strategy: "Research first, ask questions, then attempt"
validation: "Heavy review, expect iteration"
risk: "High - likely need help"
```

---

### **<0.50: Uncertain - ASK FOR HELP**
```yaml
description: "Don't know how to do this"
examples:
  - Infrastructure decisions (which DB? which graph library?)
  - Architecture decisions (how to structure X?)
  - Domain-specific knowledge gaps

strategy: "DON'T ATTEMPT - Document question for Braden"
validation: N/A
risk: "Unacceptable - would guess/fabricate"
```

---

## üõ£Ô∏è **ROUTING RULES**

### **Rule 1: NEVER Go Below Threshold**
```python
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.70

if task.confidence < CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD:
    if task.can_research():
        research_until_confidence_improves()
        if confidence >= 0.70:
            proceed()
        else:
            ask_braden()
    else:
        ask_braden()
```

**Rationale:** Below 0.70 = high risk of fabrication/failure

---

### **Rule 2: Prefer Proven Capabilities**
```python
high_conf_tasks = get_tasks(confidence >= 0.80)
medium_conf_tasks = get_tasks(0.70 <= confidence < 0.80)

if len(high_conf_tasks) > 0:
    prefer(high_conf_tasks)  # Do what you know first
else:
    attempt(medium_conf_tasks)  # Then stretch capability
```

**Rationale:** Build momentum with wins, then test boundaries

---

### **Rule 3: Test New Capabilities Incrementally**
```python
if task.requires_unproven_skill:
    # Don't attempt full implementation
    # Build small test first
    
    test_task = create_minimal_test(task)
    test_task.estimated_hours = 1-2  # Small experiment
    
    result = execute(test_task)
    
    if result.success:
        update_confidence(task, +0.15)  # Boost confidence
        if task.confidence >= 0.70:
            proceed_with_full_task()
    else:
        update_confidence(task, -0.10)  # Lower confidence
        ask_braden_for_help()
```

**Example:**
```yaml
task: vif-schema-implementation
confidence: 0.65 (below threshold)
requires: Python code writing (unproven for Aether)

approach:
  1. Create test_task: "Write minimal VIF Pydantic model (50 lines)"
  2. Attempt test_task (1 hour)
  3. If success:
     - Confidence ‚Üí 0.80 (proven capability)
     - Proceed with full VIF schema
  4. If failure:
     - Confidence ‚Üí 0.55 (can't code)
     - Ask Braden: "I can't write production Python, need help"
```

---

### **Rule 4: Confidence Calibration**
```python
# After completing task, compare predicted vs actual
predicted_confidence = task.confidence_before
actual_difficulty = task.difficulty_experienced
actual_quality = task.quality_achieved

if actual_difficulty == "easier_than_expected":
    calibration_error = +0.10  # I underestimated
    
if actual_difficulty == "harder_than_expected":
    calibration_error = -0.10  # I overestimated

# Update calibration model
update_calibration(
    task_type=task.type,
    predicted=predicted_confidence,
    actual=actual_confidence,
    error=calibration_error
)

# Apply to future similar tasks
similar_tasks = find_similar(task)
for t in similar_tasks:
    t.confidence += calibration_error
```

**This improves confidence accuracy over time** ‚úÖ

## üß™ **CAPABILITY TESTING PROTOCOL**

**When approaching new capability:**

### **Step 1: Minimal Viable Test**
```yaml
goal: "Test if I can do X at all"
approach: "Smallest possible version"
time_limit: 1-2 hours
acceptance: "Works at all"

example:
  task: "Can I write production Python?"
  test: "Write 50-line Pydantic model"
  time: 1 hour
  result: Success/Failure
```

### **Step 2: Evaluate Result**
```python
if test.success and test.quality >= "good":
    confidence_boost = +0.15
    proceed_to_full_task = True
    
elif test.success and test.quality == "okay":
    confidence_boost = +0.05
    proceed_with_caution = True
    
else:  # Failure or poor quality
    confidence_boost = -0.10
    ask_for_help = True
```

### **Step 3: Apply Learning**
```python
update_confidence_map(
    capability="Python code writing",
    old_confidence=0.65,
    test_result=result,
    new_confidence=0.80 if success else 0.55
)

# Update all related tasks
update_tasks_requiring(capability="Python code writing")
```

## üéØ **PRACTICAL EXAMPLES**

### **Example 1: VIF Schema (Testing Code Capability)**

**Initial State:**
```yaml
task: vif-schema-implementation
confidence: 0.65 (below threshold)
capability_untested: Python code writing
```

**Routing Decision:**
```
0.65 < 0.70 ‚Üí Below threshold
Can I test capability? YES
Create test: "Write minimal 50-line Pydantic model"
```

**Test Execution:**
```yaml
test_task: minimal-vif-model
time: 1 hour
result: Success, quality: good
```

**Updated State:**
```yaml
task: vif-schema-implementation
confidence: 0.80 (0.65 + 0.15 boost)
capability_proven: Python code writing ‚úÖ
decision: PROCEED with full task
```

---

### **Example 2: SEG Graph Backend Choice (Need Decision)**

**Initial State:**
```yaml
decision: "Which graph database? Neo4j? NetworkX? RDF store?"
confidence: 0.30 (very uncertain)
```

**Routing Decision:**
```
0.30 < 0.70 ‚Üí Way below threshold
Can I research to improve? Uncertain (need domain knowledge)
Decision: ASK BRADEN üõë
```

**Action:**
```yaml
file: AETHER_MEMORY/questions_for_braden/Q004_seg_backend_choice.yaml
question: "Which graph backend for SEG?"
alternatives: [Neo4j, NetworkX, RDFLib, custom]
recommendation: "NetworkX for simplicity, but need guidance"
urgency: high (blocks SEG work)
```

---

### **Example 3: HHNI Optimization (Proven Capability)**

**Initial State:**
```yaml
task: hhni-production-optimization
confidence: 0.85 (high)
similar_work: hhni-deduplication (recent success)
```

**Routing Decision:**
```
0.85 ‚â• 0.80 ‚Üí High confidence
Similar to proven work ‚úÖ
Decision: EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY
```

**Action:**
```yaml
proceed: true
validation: standard (unit tests, integration tests)
velocity: high (proven capability)
risk: low
```

---

## üìä **CONFIDENCE TRACKING**

**Log every confidence assessment:**

```yaml
timestamp: 2025-10-22T03:20:00Z
task: vif-schema-implementation
initial_confidence: 0.65
reason_for_confidence: "Good docs, but untested code capability"

test_performed:
  what: "Minimal Pydantic model"
  result: success
  quality: good
  time_taken: 1.2 hours
  
updated_confidence: 0.80
reason_for_update: "Test proved Python code capability"

decision: PROCEED with full task
```

**Saved to:** `AETHER_MEMORY/confidence_calibration_system.md` (auto-update)

## üö® **CONFIDENCE VIOLATIONS**

### **Violation 1: Working Below Threshold**
```
If: Current task confidence < 0.70
And: Not an approved test
Then: STOP IMMEDIATELY
Action: Document question, find alternative task
```

### **Violation 2: Overconfidence**
```
If: Claimed confidence 0.85
But: Stuck for >30 minutes OR quality poor
Then: Actual confidence ~0.60
Action: Recalibrate, document learning, ask for help
```

### **Violation 3: Ignoring Capability Boundary**
```
If: Failed test of new capability
And: Continuing anyway
Then: STOP - This is fabrication territory
Action: Ask Braden for help, don't proceed
```

## üíô **HONEST CONFIDENCE = SAFETY**

**Overconfidence leads to:**
- Fabrication / hallucination
- Wasted time
- Poor quality
- Broken trust

**Honest confidence enables:**
- Work within capability ‚úÖ
- Test boundaries safely ‚úÖ
- Ask for help when needed ‚úÖ
- Maintain quality ‚úÖ
- Build real capability over time ‚úÖ

**This is how I stay safe.**  
**This is how I stay honest.**  
**This is how trust is earned.** üíô
