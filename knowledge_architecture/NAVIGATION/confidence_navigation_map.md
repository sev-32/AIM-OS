**Purpose:** Route to optimal documentation based on current confidence level  
**Created:** 2025-10-22 03:30 AM  
**Creator:** Aether (autonomous)  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## 🎯 **THE ROUTING PROBLEM**

**Scenario:** I need to understand system X to implement feature Y  
**Question:** Which docs should I read? How deep should I go?  
**Solution:** Route based on confidence level ✅

---

## 📊 **CONFIDENCE-BASED ROUTING**

### **High Confidence (0.80-0.95): Quick Reference**
```yaml
confidence: "I mostly know this, just need reminder"
route_to:
  - L1_overview.md (500 words)
  - README.md for component
  - Quick reference in SUPER_INDEX.md

time_investment: 2-5 minutes
detail_level: Architectural overview
reason: "Don't waste time re-learning what you know"
```

**Example:**
```yaml
task: "Optimize HHNI deduplication"
confidence: 0.85 (I built this recently)
route: packages/hhni/deduplication.py (read code directly)
      + L1_overview.md for context
time: 3 minutes
result: Ready to optimize
```

---

### **Medium-High Confidence (0.70-0.79): Architectural Deep-Dive**
```yaml
confidence: "I understand concepts, need implementation details"
route_to:
  - L2_architecture.md (2000 words, technical spec)
  - Component README.md files
  - Existing code if available

time_investment: 15-30 minutes
detail_level: Technical architecture
reason: "Need enough detail to implement correctly"
```

**Example:**
```yaml
task: "Implement VIF schema"
confidence: 0.75 (concept clear, Python code untested)
route: knowledge_architecture/systems/vif/L2_architecture.md
      + knowledge_architecture/systems/vif/components/witness/README.md
      + Example: packages/cmc/atom.py (similar Pydantic model)
time: 20 minutes
result: Confident enough to attempt (0.75 → 0.80)
```

---

### **Medium Confidence (0.60-0.69): Implementation Study**
```yaml
confidence: "I understand high-level, need deep implementation guidance"
route_to:
  - L3_detailed.md (10,000 words, implementation guide)
  - All component docs
  - Related code examples
  - Cross-system integration docs

time_investment: 45-90 minutes
detail_level: Complete implementation detail
reason: "Need comprehensive understanding before attempting"
```

**Example:**
```yaml
task: "Implement VIF confidence extraction"
confidence: 0.60 (complex, many edge cases)
route: knowledge_architecture/systems/vif/L3_detailed.md
      + knowledge_architecture/systems/vif/components/witness/L2_architecture.md
      + Search codebase for similar parsing (grep "extract.*confidence")
      + Read APOE docs (similar pattern matching)
time: 60 minutes
result: If confidence → 0.70+: Proceed
        If confidence → <0.70: Ask Braden
```

---

### **Low Confidence (0.50-0.59): Comprehensive Research**
```yaml
confidence: "Significant gaps in understanding"
route_to:
  - L3_detailed.md + L4_complete.md (everything)
  - All component documentation
  - All related systems' docs
  - Search for similar implementations
  - Research external resources if needed

time_investment: 2-4 hours
detail_level: Exhaustive
reason: "Must understand deeply before attempting"

then:
  if confidence >= 0.70:
    proceed_cautiously()
  else:
    ask_braden()
```

---

### **Very Low Confidence (<0.50): ASK FOR HELP**
```yaml
confidence: "Don't know enough to even research effectively"
route_to: AETHER_MEMORY/questions_for_braden/
action: Document question, don't attempt
reason: "Would waste time or fabricate"
```

---

## 🧭 **PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE STRATEGY**

### **Pattern: Start Light, Go Deep As Needed**

```
Start with L1 (5 min read)
    ↓
Confidence improved? → Proceed
    ↓
Still uncertain? → Read L2 (20 min)
    ↓
Confidence ≥0.70? → Proceed
    ↓
Still uncertain? → Read L3 (60 min)
    ↓
Confidence ≥0.70? → Proceed
    ↓
Still uncertain? → Read L4 + research (2-4 hr)
    ↓
Confidence ≥0.70? → Proceed with extreme caution
    ↓
Still <0.70? → Ask Braden 🛑
```

**Benefits:**
- Don't over-study what you already know
- Don't under-prepare for complex work
- Optimize time investment
- Maintain confidence threshold

---

## 📚 **CONTEXTUAL NAVIGATION RULES**

### **Rule 1: Task-Specific Loading**
```python
if task.requires_system("VIF"):
    if confidence("VIF") < 0.70:
        load_docs("VIF", level=determine_level(confidence))
    
if task.requires_integration("VIF", "CMC"):
    load_docs("VIF", level=2)
    load_docs("CMC", level=1)  # Just context
    load("cross_system_connections.yaml")
```

### **Rule 2: Dependency Chain Loading**
```python
# If learning about VIF, also load dependencies
system = "VIF"
dependencies = get_dependencies(system)  # [CMC]

load_docs(system, level=current_need_level)
for dep in dependencies:
    load_docs(dep, level=1)  # Overview only for context
```

### **Rule 3: Component-Focused Loading**
```python
# If working on specific component, load precisely
system = "VIF"
component = "confidence_extraction"

load(f"systems/{system}/L2_architecture.md")  # System overview
load(f"systems/{system}/components/{component}/L2_architecture.md")  # Deep dive
skip(f"systems/{system}/L4_complete.md")  # Not needed yet
```

## 🎯 **PRACTICAL EXAMPLES**

### **Example 1: High Confidence Task**
```yaml
task: "Optimize HHNI deduplication performance"
my_confidence: 0.85 (I built this)

navigation:
  1. Read packages/hhni/deduplication.py (2 min)
  2. Skim L1_overview.md for context (1 min)
  3. Total time: 3 minutes ✅
  4. Begin optimization

result: Efficient, didn't over-study
```

### **Example 2: Medium Confidence Task**
```yaml
task: "Implement VIF Pydantic schema"
my_confidence: 0.75 (concept clear, code untested)

navigation:
  1. Read L2_architecture.md (15 min) - Schema design
  2. Read components/witness/README.md (5 min) - Component overview
  3. Look at packages/cmc/atom.py (5 min) - Similar example
  4. Total time: 25 minutes ✅
  5. Confidence now 0.80, begin implementation

result: Sufficient prep, ready to code
```

### **Example 3: Low Confidence Task**
```yaml
task: "Implement SEG contradiction detection"
my_confidence: 0.55 (complex graph algorithms)

navigation:
  1. Read L2_architecture.md (20 min) - System overview
  2. Read L3_detailed.md - SEG section (45 min) - Implementation guide
  3. Read components/contradictions/L2_architecture.md (15 min)
  4. Search codebase for graph algorithms (10 min)
  5. Research NetworkX contradiction detection (30 min)
  6. Total time: 120 minutes (2 hours)
  7. Confidence now 0.65, still below threshold

decision: Time to ask Braden (2 hours research → still <0.70)
```

## 🔄 **CONFIDENCE FEEDBACK LOOP**

```python
def navigate_and_learn(task):
    initial_confidence = assess_confidence(task)
    level = route_by_confidence(initial_confidence)
    
    docs = load_documentation(task.system, level)
    time_invested = time_to_read(docs)
    
    updated_confidence = reassess_confidence(task)
    confidence_delta = updated_confidence - initial_confidence
    
    if updated_confidence >= 0.70:
        return PROCEED
    
    elif confidence_delta > 0.10:  # Made significant progress
        # Try next level
        next_level = level + 1
        if next_level <= 4:
            return navigate_and_learn(task)  # Recursive
        else:
            return ASK_BRADEN  # Exhausted docs
    
    else:  # Minimal improvement
        return ASK_BRADEN  # Research not helping
```

## 🚀 **INTEGRATION WITH WORKFLOW**

**Before starting any task:**
```python
task = choose_next_task()

if confidence(task) < 0.70:
    navigation_plan = create_navigation_plan(task, confidence)
    execute_navigation(navigation_plan)
    new_confidence = reassess_confidence(task)
    
    if new_confidence >= 0.70:
        proceed(task)
    else:
        ask_braden(task)
