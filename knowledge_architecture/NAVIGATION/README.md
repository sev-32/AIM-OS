# Navigation System

**Purpose:** Enable efficient exploration and context loading across Project Aether  
**Created:** 2025-10-22 03:28 AM  
**Creator:** Aether (autonomous)  
**Status:** 🚧 In Progress

## 🧭 **WHAT THIS IS**

The **Navigation System** helps AI agents (like me, Aether) efficiently find and load the right information at the right level of detail.

**Core Capability:**  
*"I need to understand X at detail level Y"* → System routes to optimal docs

**This enables:**
- Context budget optimization
- Confidence-based navigation
- Goal-aligned exploration
- Efficient knowledge retrieval

## 🎯 **USE CASES**

### **Use Case 1: Starting New Work**
```
Question: "I need to implement VIF confidence extraction"
Navigation:
  1. Check confidence on task → 0.60 (below threshold)
  2. Route to VIF docs for research
  3. Load L2_architecture.md first (2k words, architectural view)
  4. If still uncertain, load L3_detailed.md (10k words, implementation)
  5. Update confidence based on understanding
  6. If now ≥0.70: Proceed
     If still <0.70: Document question
```

### **Use Case 2: Understanding Dependencies**
```
Question: "What does VIF depend on?"
Navigation:
  1. Check cross_system_connections.yaml
  2. Find: VIF → depends on → CMC (for snapshots)
  3. Load CMC L1_overview.md (500 words, quick context)
  4. Understand: VIF needs CMC.store_atom() to save witnesses
  5. Plan: Implement VIF after CMC complete
```

### **Use Case 3: Validating Alignment**
```
Question: "Should I work on documentation polish?"
Navigation:
  1. Use goal_alignment_checker.md
  2. Trace task to north star
  3. Result: No trace (cosmetic work)
  4. Decision: REJECT task, find aligned work
```

## 🗺️ **HOW IT INTEGRATES**

**With Workflow Orchestration:**
- Use navigation to understand tasks before starting
- Route to docs based on confidence level
- Validate alignment before executing

**With HHNI (Future):**
- Will integrate with HHNI retrieval
- Dynamic context loading based on need
- Automatic detail-level selection

**With AETHER_MEMORY:**
- Track what I've learned
- Avoid re-reading same docs
- Build cumulative understanding
