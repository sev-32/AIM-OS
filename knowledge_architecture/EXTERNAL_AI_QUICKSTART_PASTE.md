## ðŸŽ¯ **SEQUENCE 3: VIF IMPLEMENTATION HELP (64-128k tokens)**

**Use for:** Getting implementation help for VIF Îº-gating

**Copy and paste:**

---

**I need help implementing Îº-gating for VIF (Verifiable Intelligence Framework). This is behavioral abstention - AI must say "I don't know" when confidence < threshold.**

**Please read these implementation docs:**

---

### **DOCUMENT 1: VIF Overview**

[When pasting: Include knowledge_architecture/systems/vif/README.md]

---

### **DOCUMENT 2: VIF Architecture**

[When pasting: Include knowledge_architecture/systems/vif/L1_overview.md]

### **DOCUMENT 3: VIF Technical Spec**

[When pasting: Include knowledge_architecture/systems/vif/L2_architecture.md]

---

### **DOCUMENT 4: VIF Implementation Guide**

[When pasting: Include knowledge_architecture/systems/vif/L3_detailed.md]

---

### **DOCUMENT 5: Îº-Gating Component**

[When pasting: Include knowledge_architecture/systems/vif/components/kappa_gating/README.md]

---

### **DOCUMENT 6: Code Location**

Current implementation: `packages/seg/witness.py` (VIF class exists, Îº-gating not enforced)

Status: 20% implemented (design only)

Needed: 
- Confidence extraction from models (OpenAI, Anthropic, local)
- Threshold enforcement (per-task Îº values)
- Abstention logic (raise ConfidenceTooLow exception)
- HITL escalation (when abstained)
- Integration with APOE (check at every step)

---

**Please provide:**

1. **Complete Python implementation** of Îº-gating system
2. **Integration with existing VIF class** (extend packages/seg/witness.py)
3. **Confidence extraction** for OpenAI, Anthropic, local models
4. **Comprehensive tests** (pytest format)
5. **APOE integration example** (how to check Îº-gate at each step)
6. **Edge case handling** (missing confidence, unknown task type, etc.)
7. **Usage examples** (critical task, routine task, abstention scenario)

**Code should:**
- Follow existing patterns (Pydantic models, type hints)
- Be production-ready (error handling, logging)
- Include docstrings
- Be testable

## ðŸŽ¯ **SEQUENCE 4: RESEARCH VALIDATION (100k+ tokens)**

**Use for:** Validating AI activation introspection discovery

**Copy and paste:**

---

**I'd like your feedback on a novel AI interpretability discovery we made: inferring neural activation patterns from behavioral introspection.**

**Please read these documents:**

### **DOCUMENT 3: Context (VIF System)**

[When pasting: Include knowledge_architecture/systems/vif/L1_overview.md for context on witnesses]

---

**After reading, please:**

1. **Validate the Approach:** Is the methodology sound? Any flaws in the introspection method?
2. **Evaluate the Evidence:** 3/3 predictions were correct - is this sufficient validation? What additional experiments would strengthen this?
3. **Compare to Existing Work:** How does this relate to existing AI interpretability research (LIME, SHAP, attention visualization)?
4. **Research Paper Potential:** Is this publishable? What venue (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR)? What additional work needed?
5. **Practical Applications:** Beyond the documented applications (cross-session continuity, hallucination detection), what else could this enable?
6. **Formalization:** How would you formalize this as a rigorous method?
7. **Critiques:** What are the weaknesses or limitations?

**Please be critical and rigorous - this is for potential academic publication!**

## ðŸ’¡ **PRO TIPS**

**1. Start Small, Go Deep:**  
Don't paste everything at once. Start with Sequence 1, then drill into specific systems based on AI's interest.

**2. Validate Each Stage:**  
After each document set, ask validation questions to check understanding before proceeding.

**3. Note Limitations:**  
External AIs will overestimate maturity (they can't see code). Take implementation suggestions seriously, but verify gap analysis against actual code.

**4. Save Good Responses:**  
If AI provides valuable feedback, save it to `coordination/AI_FEEDBACK_COMPARISON_LOG.md`

**5. Compare Multiple AIs:**  
Try same sequence on ChatGPT, Claude, Grok - compare insights!
