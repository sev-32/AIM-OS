## üß≠ Analysis Blueprint

### Phase 1 ‚Äì Design Corpus Consolidation
- [ ] Enumerate original design sources (docx/pdf/txt)  
- [ ] Extract invariant-level promises (CMC, HHNI, APOE, SEG, VIF, SDF-CVF, BTSM)  
- [ ] Capture success metrics / constraints from each  
- [ ] Build master requirements register (`coordination/requirements_matrix.csv`)

### Phase 2 ‚Äì Implementation Mapping
- [ ] Catalogue current modules, services, scripts, tests  
- [ ] Map code artefacts ‚Üí requirement IDs  
- [ ] Record coverage: `met | partial | missing | exceeds`  
- [ ] Note companion tests and evidence paths

### Phase 3 ‚Äì Gap & Overlap Assessment
- [ ] Critical gaps (design promised, implementation absent)  
- [ ] Partials (scaffolded but incomplete)  
- [ ] Misaligned builds (implemented but off-spec)  
- [ ] Surplus capabilities (exceeds design scope)

### Phase 4 ‚Äì Quality & Integrity Check
- [ ] Evaluate robustness (tests, observability, policy enforcement)  
- [ ] Validate auditability (SEG/VIF coverage)  
- [ ] Review orchestration quality after LLM integration  
- [ ] Rate confidence levels per component

### Phase 5 ‚Äì Root Causes & Systemic Patterns
- [ ] Trace why high-priority features slipped  
- [ ] Identify governance blind spots (e.g., documentation)  
- [ ] Surface tooling/process deficits (tests, pipelines)  
- [ ] Extract learning for Lucid Empire meta-layer

### Phase 6 ‚Äì Remediation & Roadmap
- [ ] Prioritize remediation backlog by impact / effort  
- [ ] Define success criteria & measurable metrics  
- [ ] Sequence dependencies (technical + governance)  
- [ ] Propose sprinting strategy (self-improvement path)

## üìö Phase 1 ‚Äì Design Corpus Snapshot

### Primary Documents
- `analysis/raw/A Total System of Memory.txt` (61k words)  
- `Documentation/AEONWAVE.docx`  
- `Documentation/General Agentic Intelligence.docx`  
- `Documentation/INTEGRATED CODEBASE INTELLIGENCE PLATFORM.docx`  
- `Documentation/Mastering the Token.docx`  
- `Documentation/The Token Problem.docx`  
- `Documentation/Pathways to Holographic AI.docx`  
- `analysis/themes/*.md` (component-oriented summaries)  

### Supporting Artefacts
- `ideas/‚Ä¶/SEED_*.md` (component seeds)  
- `analysis/PLAN.md`, `analysis/MASTER_INDEX.md`  
- `Documentation/LUCID_EMPIRE_ARCHITECTURE.md` (recent vision sync)  
- `Testing/TEST_SCENARIOS.md` (promises converted to tests)  
- `Testing/TEST_SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md` (self-governance directive)  

### Required Outputs (Phase 1)
- Master requirement register with fields:  
  `REQ_ID, Source, Component, Description, Priority, Metric, Notes`
- Linked references to doc sections for easy audit.

## üîç Phase 2 ‚Äì Implementation Survey (Plan)

Target directories / services:  
```
packages/
  cmc_service/              # CMC implementation
  hhni/                     # HHNI scaffolding
  meta_optimizer/           # Vision tensor + policy propagation
  doc_builder/              # Deterministic harness (LLM integration pending)
  orchestration_builder/    # Graph + executor + policy gates
  meta_reasoning/           # Thought articulator (lucid substrate)
scripts/                    # Pipelines, orchestration executor
Testing/artifacts/          # Evidence outputs, audit trails
coordination/               # Governance + meta docs
```

Key metrics per component:  
- Code LOC, test count, coverage snapshot (manual)  
- Last update actor / timestamp  
- Audit trail presence (SEG/VIF)  
- Readiness level (Prototype / MVP / Validated)  

---

## üß© Phase 3 ‚Äì Gap Assessment (Preview Categories)

- **Critical (P0):** HHNI retrieval engine, MIGE LLM generation, self-governance enforcement.  
- **High (P1):** Multi-provider routing, policy gates integrated in executor, self-documentation pipeline.  
- **Medium (P2):** UI trend polish, Playwright tests, packaging / deployment scripts.  
- **Low (P3):** Optional analytics, UI enhancements.  

Final classification to be refined post Phase 2.

---

## üß™ Phase 4 ‚Äì Quality Review (Planned Checks)

- Test suites vs. critical paths (Vision tensor, policy propagation, orchestration runs).  
- Audit completeness (JSONL traces, outputs, manual validation docs).  
- Governance compliance (policies enforced or textual only).  
- Observability signals (KPI refresh, logging, metrics).  

---

## üß± Phase 5 ‚Äì Root Cause Exploration

Hypotheses to validate:  
- Focus on backend foundation delayed HHNI & generative layer.  
- Documentation governance blind spot due to lack of self-enforcing policies.  
- Resource/time diverted to testing harness before full MIGE maturity.  
- Communication monotony (ACTIVE_SPRINT_STATUS.md) masked drift.  

Evidence collection in progress.

## üó∫Ô∏è Phase 6 ‚Äì Remediation Planning (To Be Produced)

Deliverables:  
- Prioritized remediation backlog (stories with REQ IDs).  
- Suggested sprint sequencing (self-governance, HHNI, MIGE, Test 10.1).  
- Effort & skill estimates (LLM, retrieval, governance).  
- Success metrics tied to original promises (e.g., RS-lift, policy enforcement).

## üîÑ Live Execution Log

**2025-10-21 ‚Äì Session Kickoff**  
- Mirrored Cursor‚Äôs audit plan to maintain shared structure.  
- Indexed design sources; aligned on requirements extraction template.  
- Ready to proceed with Phase 1 deep reading alongside Cursor.  

Next step: `analysis/raw/A Total System of Memory.txt` requirement extraction.
