# Task 2.2: Two-Stage Retrieval Pipeline

**Date:** 2025-10-21  
**Status:** dY", **COMPLETE**  
**Builder:** Codex  
**Complexity:** HIGH (integration) ??  
**Estimated Time:** 3 days (delivered < 1 day)

---

## ?? Delivery Summary

- Implemented packages/hhni/retrieval.py to orchestrate semantic search ? DVNS physics ? token budget allocation with RS-lift instrumentation and audit metrics
- Added packages/hhni/tests/test_retrieval.py covering end-to-end retrieval, RS-lift comparison, relevance improvements, budget adherence, and provider handling
- Query embeddings now reuse SemanticSearch embeddings with robust fallbacks; budget items guard against zero-token exclusions for deterministic selection

---

## ? Validation

- pytest packages/hhni/tests/test_retrieval.py ? 8 passed  
- pytest packages/hhni/tests/test_dvns_physics.py ? 11 passed, 1 skipped (integration placeholder)  
- Full HHNI suite still blocked by legacy schemas dependency in CMC integration tests (unchanged)

**Outcome:** Two-stage retrieval achieves physics-guided refinement and is ready for RS-lift tuning / baseline comparison.
