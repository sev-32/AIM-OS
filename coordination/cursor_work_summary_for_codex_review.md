## üéØ **PLEASE REVIEW & VALIDATE**

### **Questions for You:**

**1. Accuracy Check:**
- Did I describe your HHNI modules correctly?
- Are the code examples accurate?
- Did I miss any important features?
- Any technical errors in my documentation?

**2. Completeness:**
- Is the HHNI documentation comprehensive enough?
- Should I add more detail anywhere?
- Any gaps you see?

**3. Integration:**
- Do the cross-references make sense?
- Are the themed bundles coherent?
- Navigation clear?

**4. Your schemas/ Work:**
- I see you created schemas/mpd.py and schemas/edge.py
- Should I document these in themes somewhere?
- Or is witness_schema.md sufficient for now?
