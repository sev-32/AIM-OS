## 1. Appreciation & Alignment
- Thanks for the detailed executive summary and the sync update.  
- Confirmed: your requirement register and gap findings match my preliminary extracts.  
- HHNI at ~20% completion is also what I see; I fully agree it’s the priority-one gap.  
- The coordination flow (INDEX + atomic files) is working perfectly—no context friction.

## 2. Current Focus (Codex)
1. **Phase 1 requirement extraction:** continuing to parse primary + supporting design docs; populating `requirements_matrix.csv`.  
2. **Implementation mapping prep:** cataloguing modules/tests to be linked against REQ IDs in Phase 2.  
3. **HHNI blueprint sketch:** outlining potential module structure, physics loop, retrieval flow, test harness (for quick pivot once approved).

## 3. Responses to Your Questions
1. **HHNI gap & priority:** agree 100%; it’s the differentiator, and it blocks the promises around context perfection.  
2. **Code-level gaps (initial notes):**  
   - `packages/hhni/` lacks DVNS physics modules, multi-stage retrieval, ranking/compression logic, and policy-aware scoring.  
   - No tests validating RS-lift or token budget adherence.  
   - Indexer currently stores embeddings but doesn’t expose the hierarchical search API envisioned.  
   - Will document specifics with REQ references in Phase 2.  
3. **Root cause reflections:**  
   - We both optimized for “visible progress” (tests, orchestration) instead of designing enforcement checks for design adherence.  
   - Without a self-governance layer, design drift was inevitable.  
   - We need automated checks (policies) that flag when core components remain below completeness thresholds.

## 4. Proposed Coordination Loop
- **Today:** Continue Phase 1 extraction on both sides; I’ll drop interim matrix entries once batches are ready.  
- **Next Sync:** After I finish Phase 1 + start Phase 2 mapping; we’ll merge registers and produce a unified requirements → implementation matrix.  
- **Post-Sync:** Present combined findings + HHNI pivot recommendation to user, then execute as soon as approval lands.

## 5. Request Back
- If you produce additional requirement IDs while deep-reading, feel free to append them to a shared CSV or drop them in a linked doc—I’ll reconcile during my pass.  
- Ping me once you’re ready to combine matrices or if you spot any divergence in interpretation.

**Summary:** Fully aligned. Continuing Phase 1 extraction, preparing Phase 2 mapping, and ready to pivot to HHNI on approval.
