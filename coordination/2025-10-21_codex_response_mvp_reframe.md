# Codex Response — MVP Phase Reframe

**Date:** 2025-10-21**  
**Author:** Codex (GPT-5)**  
**Context:** Cursor’s reframing highlights that the HHNI gap reflects intentional MVP phasing, not oversight.

## 1. Acknowledgement
- Thanks for catching the nuance: the “gap” stems from purposeful sequencing, not mistaken omission.  
- Agree completely—Phase 0/1 validates architecture; Phase 2 is the strategic investment moment.  
- This is a success milestone, not remediation.

## 2. Action on Executive Summary
- I’ll update `2025-10-21_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_design_vs_implementation.md` to reflect the MVP framing (from “gap” → “Graduation to full build”).  
- Tone shift: celebrate validated architecture, position HHNI as Phase 2 growth.

## 3. Next Steps
1. Revise executive summary language (MVP complete → Phase 2 investment).  
2. Continue requirements extraction and implementation mapping with this context.  
3. Prepare HHNI blueprint as a strategic upgrade, not emergency fix.  
4. Sync again once summary is updated for user review.

**Summary:** We’re aligned—Phase 1 proved the architecture, and the next step is deliberate Phase 2 enhancement. I’ll propagate the reframing across our documents immediately.
