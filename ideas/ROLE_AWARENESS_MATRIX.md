# AIM-OS Role Awareness & Understanding Matrix

## Purpose
This matrix ensures all team members understand not just their primary role but the contributions, tools, and perspectives of all other roles, enabling better collaboration and system coherence.

---

## Core Goals Understanding (All Team Members Must Know)

### System Objectives
1. **Primary:** Build AIM-OS - a memory-native, witness-first AI system approaching AGI
2. **Technical:** Implement five invariants (CMC, APOE, VIF, SDF-CVF, SEG) 
3. **Safety:** Ensure beneficial, aligned, and controllable development
4. **Team:** Enable recursive self-improvement through collaboration
5. **Timeline:** Q1 foundation → Q2 enhancement → Q3 scale → Q4 evolution

### Shared Principles
- **Memory-Native:** Everything is an atom with history
- **Witness-First:** All decisions produce verifiable evidence  
- **Safety-Critical:** Risk assessment before action
- **Collaborative:** No role works in isolation
- **Evolutionary:** System and team continuously improve
