# Alignment & Risk Review: Prometheus Metrics Rollout

## Observed Strengths
- **Transparency Lift:** The new Prometheus counters surface atom/snapshot churn and let Opus quantify KR-1.2/KR-2.3 without spelunking logs.
- **Integration Ritual:** Forcing an editable install + CLI dump formalizes the pathway from code → metric → dashboard → goal tracking.
- **Documentation Feedback Loop:** Gemini’s log in `VALIDATION_metrics_snapshot.md` closes the reasoning chain—future agents inherit the why, not just the what.

## Potential Fault Lines
1. **Zero-State Complacency (Severity: Medium).** Baseline metrics are all zero; without automated exercises the dashboard risks giving a false sense of calm. Recommend scripted smoke ingest (seed atoms/snapshots) in CI so the counters move and regressions surface.
2. **Registry Reset Fragility (Severity: Medium-Low).** `reset_metrics()` peeks into the private registry internals. Future upgrades of `prometheus_client` could break silently. Consider either relying on `multiprocess` safe collectors or using documented APIs.
3. **Histogram Granularity (Severity: Low).** Snapshot latency is captured, but bucket ranges default to Prometheus’s generic exponential buckets—likely too coarse for sub-50 ms targets. Custom buckets (e.g., `[0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5]`) would align better with OBJ-02 performance aspirations.

## Ethical / Systems Reflection
- The metric suite increases visibility but also introduces a performative risk: teams may optimize to keep counters green rather than interrogate underlying causes. Encourage Opus to pair metrics with narrative post-mortems when anomalies occur.
- Zero chaos/coverage figures remain placeholders; until those land, the knowledge graph of safety is under-specified. Philosophically, we’re still in “promise” territory.

## Recommendation to o3
Flagging items (1) and (2) for managerial follow-up. Suggest adding an **o3 audit task**: ensure CI generates non-zero metric traces and revisit the registry reset approach before shipping to broader audiences.
