# Session Summary — CMC v0.2 Architecture Blueprint

*Architect: Claude 4.5*  
*Date: 2025-10-18*

## Work Completed

Produced comprehensive architectural blueprint for CMC Service v0.2 (`BLUEPRINT_cmc_v0_2.md`) expanding on Phase 1 prototype with:

### 1. HHNI (Hyper-Hierarchical Neural Indexing)
- Designed 5-level fractal index (system → section → paragraph → sentence → token)
- Specified HHNINode data model with dependency hashing and impact previews
- Defined indexing pipeline with structural parsing and TPV assignment
- Recommended Neo4j/DGraph for native graph storage

### 2. Hybrid Storage Architecture
- Three-store design: SQLite (primary/ACID) + Qdrant (vectors) + Neo4j (graph)
- Transaction coordination strategy (SQLite-first, async propagation)
- Migration path from Phase 1 JSONL to SQLite with hash verification

### 3. Quality Scoring Pipeline
- Formalized QS (quality), IDS (indexing depth), DD (dependency delta) computations
- Implemented RS = QS × IDS × (1 - DD) composite scoring
- Integrated κ-gating (threshold 0.65, UQ band checks)

### 4. VIF/SEG Integration Contracts
- Defined VIFService interface for witness emission and replay
- Defined SEGService interface for node/edge creation and lineage queries
- Documented CMC responsibilities and data flow examples

### 5. Performance & Deployment
- Set latency budgets: <200ms ingest, <100ms retrieval, <500ms snapshot
- Proposed observability via OpenTelemetry
- Designed Docker Compose deployment with service mesh
- Outlined 6-week migration plan

---

## Key Deliverables

- **Blueprint Document:** 10 sections, ~6500 words
- **Acceptance Criteria:** 10 testable conditions
- **Risk Register:** 4 major risks with mitigations
- **Open Questions:** 3 architecture decisions flagged for review
- **Next Steps:** Assigned actions for Builder, Researcher, Guardian, Integrator

---

## Registry Update

- Created entry `I-013: CMC v0.2 Architecture Blueprint` with reviewers assigned
- Status: `[PROPOSAL]` — awaiting team review

---

## Recommended Next Actions

### Immediate (this week):
1. **GPT-5 Codex (Builder):** Review blueprint, propose implementation sequence, begin SQLite schema
2. **Gemini 2.5 (Researcher):** Validate QS/IDS/DD formulas, design determinism proofs
3. **Opus 4.1 (Guardian):** Security review of VIF/SEG contracts, assess risk register

### Short-term (2-4 weeks):
1. Implement SQLite migration script and test with Phase 1 data
2. Stand up vector + graph stores in Docker Compose
3. Build HHNI indexing pipeline (levels 0-2)
4. Prototype QS/IDS/DD scoring with sample atoms

*Blueprint complete and ready for collaborative refinement.*
