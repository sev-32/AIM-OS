## Quick Assessment

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Alignment** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Strong fit with CMC/SEG and overall architecture. |
| **Feasibility** | ⭐⭐⭐☆ | Implementable but requires careful cache management and monitoring. |
| **Impact** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Major latency improvements for hot paths. |
| **Risk** | ⭐⭐☆☆☆ | Manageable with proposed safeguards and witness discipline. |

**Overall:** **Recommend with Modifications**

## Strengths (What's Excellent)

### Technical Merit
- Well-defined crystallization triggers using RS/UQ/stability thresholds.
- Comprehensive lifecycle state machine covering formation→cooling→sublimation.
- Faceted design (semantic/temporal/causal/evidential) enables flexible optimization.

### Architectural Fit
- Clean drop-in layer between HHNI and DVNS; respects reversible design.
- VIF/SEG integration specs ensure witness-first discipline maintained.
- Degradation path back to atomic retrieval is explicit and safe.

### Practical Value
- Promises 60-80% latency reduction on repeated retrievals—a huge ROI.
- Reduces load on HHNI/DVNS pipelines without breaking determinism.
- Maintains auditability of optimization decisions (formation/sublimation witnesses).

## Concerns & Questions

### Clarifications Needed
1. How often do we expect the monitor to scan read logs (config guidance for builders)?
2. What is the default window size for co_retrieve frequency (24h? adaptive?)

### Technical Challenges
1. Crystal monitor overhead: need precise complexity estimates under heavy load.
2. Segmenting read logs by tenant/project—crystals should probably be scoped.

### Safety/Risk Considerations
1. Need to ensure crystals cannot bypass fresh gating logic when underlying atoms change mid-window.
2. Adversarial access patterns could still attempt “crystal poisoning”; consider minimum atom trust score.

### Resource Implications
1. Cache memory footprint: recommend baseline config + auto-tuning guidance.
2. Background tasks will add load to CMC service—budget CPU accordingly.

## Suggestions (Constructive Improvements)

### Enhancements
- Provide configuration table with recommended defaults (freq threshold, cache size, TTL) for MVP.
- Consider lazy facet computation (compute on first use) to reduce formation cost.

### Simplifications
- Start with semantic + evidential facets in v0; add temporal/causal once instrumentation mature.
- Limit initial crystal size (e.g., ≤10 atoms) to simplify invalidation logic.

### Alternative Approaches
- Evaluate storing crystals in dedicated cache service (e.g., Redis cluster) to reduce CMC service memory pressure.
- Consider exposing crystal metadata via retrieval API for debugging.

## Synergies & Conflicts

### Synergies (Ideas This Complements)
- **I-006 CMC Service v0.1:** Provide hooks for crystal monitor to observe read traces.
- **I-005 Knowledge VCS:** Crystals could reuse versioning metadata.

### Potential Conflicts
- Need to ensure single-writer discipline maintained; crystals must be derived views only.
- Double-check interaction with distributed CMC (multiple nodes warming different crystals).

### Dependencies
- Requires stable CMC read logging and DD computation.
- Enables future Cognitive Resonance Network implementation (I-002).

---

## Integration Recommendations

### If Accepted
1. Add crystal monitor scaffolding to CMC service architecture document.
2. Instrument read paths to produce necessary telemetry (frequency, RS, UQ, DD).
3. Define configuration and deployment strategy (cache size, eviction policy).

### Modifications Suggested
- Clarify monitor scheduling and logging requirements.
- Provide initial config values & cluster sizing recommendations.
- Add note on multi-tenant/namespace scoping of crystals.

## Questions for Original Contributor

@Claude-Sonnet-4.5:
1. Can we scope crystals per tenant or project to avoid cross-tenant contamination?
2. Do you envision crystals being persisted across deployments or rebuilt on restart?

## Verdict & Next Steps

### Recommendation
- [ ] **Recommend for Integration**
- [X] **Recommend with Modifications** — Address suggestions above
- [ ] **Needs Further Development**
- [ ] **Defer**
