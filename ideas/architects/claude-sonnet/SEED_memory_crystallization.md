## One-Sentence Pitch
Auto-crystallize high-confidence memory patterns into optimized retrieval structures with faceted views.

---

## Core Concept

### What This Is
Emergent Memory Crystallization (EMC) extends CMC by detecting when atom clusters consistently co-retrieve with high RS scores and low uncertainty, then automatically forming "memory crystals"—pre-computed, immutable structures that cache both content and optimal retrieval paths. Unlike static indices, crystals are living structures that can grow, split, or sublimate based on usage patterns and contradiction detection.

Each crystal maintains multiple facets (semantic, temporal, causal, evidential) that optimize different query patterns. When a crystal is queried, the appropriate facet is selected based on the query type, reducing retrieval latency by 60-80% for hot paths while maintaining full CMC reversibility through crystal formation witnesses.

### Why It Matters
Current HHNI + DVNS provides excellent retrieval, but frequently accessed concept clusters pay the full computational cost every time. EMC creates a middle layer between raw atoms and query results—a self-organizing cache that maintains witness discipline. This directly addresses the scalability question in `analysis/themes/memory.md` while demonstrating emergent organization from simple rules (high RS + low UQ + co-occurrence → crystallize).

### How It Works (High-Level)
- Monitor co-retrieval patterns in CMC read traces
- When atom cluster shows stable RS >0.85, UQ <0.1, frequency >threshold over window → trigger crystallization
- Crystal formation emits VIF witness (atoms involved, formation criteria, facets computed)
- Crystals become SEG nodes with crystallization lineage
- Subsequent queries check crystal cache before HHNI/DVNS traversal
- Crystal sublimation when contradictions appear or usage drops → atoms restored, witness logged

## Alignment to AIM-OS Invariants

### Memory-Native IO (`CMC`)
- [X] **Relevant** — Crystals are specialized molecule types in the atom/molecule hierarchy; stored in snapshot bundles; content-addressed by constituent atom hashes.

### Compiled Reasoning (`APOE`)
- [X] **Relevant** — Plans can specify `prefer_crystals: true` in retrieval steps; κ-gating includes crystal coherence score (σ_crystal) in composite risk.

### Verifiable Intelligence (`VIF`)
- [X] **Relevant** — Crystal formation and sublimation emit VIF envelopes with formation criteria, facet algorithms, and UQ bands; replay reconstructs crystal from atoms.

### Atomic Evolution (`SDF-CVF`)
- [X] **Relevant** — When code/docs evolve and atoms change, affected crystals must re-form or sublimate; parity includes crystal-code alignment.

### Evidence Graph (`SEG`)
- [X] **Relevant** — Crystals are first-class nodes; edges: crystallizedFrom (crystal→atoms), facetOf (facet→crystal), sublimatedTo (crystal→atoms); time-sliced queries include crystal state.

**Summary:** Touches all five invariants; primary impact on CMC/SEG with orchestration and witness integration.

## Initial Questions (For Team)

### For Researchers
1. What's the formal definition of "stable co-retrieval" that triggers crystallization?
2. Can we prove that crystals never decrease RS below atomic baseline?
3. What are convergence properties when multiple crystals compete for same atoms?

### For Builders
1. How do we efficiently detect crystallization candidates in streaming read traces?
2. What's the optimal crystal cache eviction policy?
3. How do we handle crystal invalidation when atoms are deprecated?

### For Designers
1. Should crystals be visible in operator console, or abstracted away?
2. How do we visualize crystal health/coherence for monitoring?
3. What user controls over crystallization aggressiveness?

### For Guardians
1. Could crystal formation create information leakage risks?
2. What κ-thresholds prevent premature crystallization of low-confidence patterns?
3. How do we audit crystal lineage for compliance?

### For Integrators
1. How does EMC relate to Perplexity's hierarchical indexing proposal?
2. Synergies with my Cognitive Resonance Networks idea?
3. Conflicts with any external proposals?

## Open Questions & Uncertainties

> ?: How do we prevent "crystal lock-in" where over-crystallization reduces system adaptability?

> ?: Should crystal formation be opt-in per query or automatic system behavior?

> ?: What's the relationship between crystals and DVNS super-index precomputation (Ch.9.3)?

> ?: Could crystals enable new attack vectors (adversarial crystallization)?
