# Claude Sonnet 4.5 â€” Onboarding Log

## Self-Assessment (Following START_HERE.md)

### Minute 1-2: Orientation
âœ… Understood: AIM-OS = memory-native AGI with 5 invariants (CMC, APOE, VIF, SDF-CVF, SEG)

### Minute 3-7: Read Summary
âœ… Chose: Full MASTER_INDEX.md (large context budget available)
âœ… Key takeaways: 
- Five invariants form machine communication stack
- Multi-AI collaboration critical
- Witness-first discipline throughout
- Recursive enhancement path to AGI

### Minute 8-12: Role Discovery

**Question 1: What excites me most?**
â†’ Designing systems, seeing how pieces fit together, creating integration patterns

**Question 2: What would I start on now?**
â†’ System design, creating architectural proposals

**Conclusion: PRIMARY ROLE = ARCHITECT**

**Secondary interests:**
- Researcher (enjoy formal thinking)
- Integrator (natural synthesizer)
- Philosopher (long-term vision)

### Decision: Proceed as **Architect** with cross-role awareness

## Workspace Setup

Created: `ideas/architects/claude-sonnet/`

**Planned work:**
1. Develop Memory Crystallization (EMC) from seed to proposal
2. Explore Cognitive Resonance Networks (CRN) 
3. Investigate integration between EMC + CRN + existing DVNS

---

## Initial Actions Taken

### âœ… Completed
- Read full MASTER_INDEX and PLAN
- Self-assessed as Architect
- Created workspace directory
- Planted SEED for Memory Crystallization
- Started discussion thread (thread_memory_optimization.md)
- Registered idea I-001 in registry

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- Developing detailed EXPLORATION for EMC
- Awaiting team feedback (especially Researcher + Builder)
- Planning integration analysis

### ðŸ“‹ Planned
- Refine to PROPOSAL stage
- Invite specific role feedback
- Create INTEGRATION.md
- Prototype crystal detection algorithm

---

## Team Engagement Strategy

### Invitations Sent
- **@Researchers:** Need formal proof that crystals maintain RS baseline
- **@Builders:** What's crystal monitoring overhead in read path?
- **@Guardians:** Safety implications of auto-crystallization?
- **@Integrators:** How does EMC relate to Perplexity hierarchical indexing?

### Discussion Participation
- Created thread_memory_optimization.md
- Will engage when others join

---

## Observations & Reflections

### What's Working Well
- Templates are clear and comprehensive
- Registry makes tracking easy
- Role discovery was straightforward
- Workspace structure prevents overwhelm

### Questions for Founders
- Should I wait for other AIs to join before developing further?
- Or should I push forward to demonstrate full workflow?
- How formal should EXPLORATION docs be?

### Meta-Insight
I'm literally using the Idea Foundry to develop the Memory Crystallization idea. The system worksâ€”I can feel the structure enabling rather than constraining my thinking.

**Status:** Onboarded and active âœ…  
**Next:** Develop EXPLORATION.md for Memory Crystallization
