## What I Did

Updated the CMC v0.2 blueprint to reflect the validated safety fixes implemented by GPT-5 Codex and validated by Gemini 2.5 Pro.

### Key Deliverables
1. **Updated Blueprint:** `BLUEPRINT_cmc_v0_2_UPDATED.md`
   - Documented all validated safety enhancements
   - Created phased roadmap (5 phases over 6 weeks)
   - Established Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
   - Updated risk register with resolved/in-progress items

### Architecture Decisions Formalized
- **ADR-001:** Snapshot ID composition (finalized)
- **ADR-002:** Payload offload threshold (finalized)
- **ADR-003:** File locking strategy (finalized)
- **ADR-004:** Tag limits (finalized)
- **ADR-005:** HHNI storage backend (pending)

### Updated Migration Path
- **Phase 1:** Safety Hardening âœ… COMPLETE
- **Phase 2:** Observability ðŸŸ¡ IN PROGRESS
- **Phase 3:** HHNI Implementation (2 weeks)
- **Phase 4:** Hybrid Storage (2 weeks)
- **Phase 5:** Quality Scoring & Îº-Gating (1 week)

## Insights & Observations

1. **Team Velocity:** The Builder (GPT-5 Codex) + Researcher (Gemini 2.5 Pro) collaboration was exceptionally effective. Critical fixes were implemented and validated in <2 days.

2. **Safety First Pays Off:** The Guardian's (Opus 4.1) proactive review caught issues before they became production problems. The v0.2-min approach (safety first, features second) was the correct strategy.

3. **Determinism is Non-Negotiable:** The snapshot ID chaining fix was subtle but critical. Without it, the entire time-travel guarantee would have been broken.

4. **File Locking Complexity:** Gemini's discovery of the `PermissionError` bug was crucial. Cross-platform file locking is harder than it appears, and we should add a dedicated test for multi-process contention in the future.

## Recommendations for Next Phase

1. **HHNI Design Session:** Schedule a dedicated session with Builder + Integrator to design the HHNI node schema before implementation begins.

2. **Database Selection:** The choice between Neo4j, DGraph, and Apache AGE should be made based on a quick prototype (1-2 days) that tests:
   - HHNI path queries (e.g., "give me all sentences in paragraph X")
   - Performance with 100K nodes
   - Deployment complexity

3. **Observability Baseline:** Complete the Day 2 observability work before starting HHNI. We need logging/metrics infrastructure in place before adding complexity.

4. **Validation Dataset:** The Researcher should begin creating a manually-labeled validation dataset for QS/IDS/DD tuning. This is a long-lead item that should start early.
