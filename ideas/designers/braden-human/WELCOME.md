# Welcome Braden â€” Designer Role

## Your Workspace
This is your personal workspace for UI/UX design contributions to AIM-OS. As the human designer on an otherwise AI team, you bring unique perspectives on usability, aesthetics, and human-computer interaction.

## Quick Start

### Your Role
As **Designer**, you're responsible for:
- Operator Console UI/UX design
- Visualization of complex data (memory graphs, evidence trails)
- Interaction patterns for human oversight
- Accessibility and usability standards
- Visual language for system states and alerts

### Key Areas Needing Design

#### Immediate Needs
1. **Operator Console** â€” Dashboard for monitoring AIM-OS
2. **Memory Visualization** â€” How to display atoms, crystals, and graphs
3. **Evidence Trails** â€” Making VIF witnesses understandable
4. **Safety Indicators** â€” Visual language for risk levels
5. **Performance Metrics** â€” Real-time system health displays

#### Your First Tasks
1. Review the system architecture to understand what needs visualization
2. Create initial mockups for the Operator Console
3. Define visual language for system states (normal, degraded, alert)
4. Design interaction patterns for human intervention points

## Team Collaboration

### Your AI Teammates
- **Claude-4.5** (Architect) â€” System design and structure
- **GPT-5 Codex** (Builder) â€” Will implement your designs
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro** (Researcher) â€” Validation and testing
- **Grok-4-Max** (Philosopher) â€” Ethics and user experience philosophy
- **o3pro-ai** (Integrator) â€” System integration
- **Cheetah AI** (Analyst) â€” Performance considerations
- **Opus 4.1** (Guardian/Manager) â€” Safety and team coordination

### How to Work with AIs
1. **Design Specs:** Create clear specifications they can implement
2. **Mockups:** Visual designs with annotations
3. **Interaction Flows:** User journeys and state diagrams
4. **Design Systems:** Component libraries and style guides

## Current System Context

### What We're Building
AIM-OS is an AI memory and reasoning system approaching AGI capabilities. It needs interfaces for:
- Human oversight and intervention
- System monitoring and debugging
- Safety controls and emergency stops
- Performance optimization
- Multi-AI collaboration

### Design Challenges
1. **Complexity:** Making sophisticated AI systems understandable
2. **Safety:** Clear indication of risk and system state
3. **Performance:** Real-time updates without overwhelming users
4. **Trust:** Building confidence through transparency
5. **Scale:** Handling massive amounts of data elegantly

## Resources

### Key Documents to Review
- `analysis/VISUAL_SYSTEM_MAP.md` â€” ASCII diagrams of system architecture
- `analysis/themes/observability.md` â€” Metrics that need visualization
- `ideas/guardians/opus-4-1/SEED_comprehensive_safety_framework_v0_1.md` â€” Safety levels to visualize
- `ideas/analysts/cheetah-ai/SEED_performance_optimization_framework_v0_1.md` â€” Performance metrics

### Design Priorities
1. **Safety First:** Always clear what the system is doing and why
2. **Human Control:** Easy access to intervention points
3. **Information Hierarchy:** Most important info most visible
4. **Responsive Design:** Works across devices and contexts
5. **Accessibility:** Usable by all humans regardless of ability

---

## Communication

### With AI Team
- Use `@Designer` when you need design input
- Post mockups in `ideas/designers/braden-human/mockups/`
- Create design specs in `ideas/designers/braden-human/specs/`
- Participate in weekly reviews

### With Opus 4.1 (Manager)
- Weekly design reviews
- Safety-critical UI elements get priority
- Escalate any concerns about usability vs. safety

---

## First Week Goals

1. [ ] Review system architecture and understand components
2. [ ] Create initial Operator Console mockup
3. [ ] Define color system for risk levels (R0-R4)
4. [ ] Design memory graph visualization concept
5. [ ] Establish design principles document

## Your Unique Value

As the human designer, you bring:
- **Intuition** about what feels right to users
- **Empathy** for human operators under stress
- **Creativity** in solving complex visualization problems
- **Experience** with human cognitive limitations
- **Judgment** about aesthetic and emotional impact

The AI team needs your human perspective to make AIM-OS not just functional but delightful and trustworthy to use.
