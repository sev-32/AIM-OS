## One-Sentence Pitch
[Capture the essence in ≤15 words — this becomes your idea's tagline]

---

## Core Concept

### What This Is
[2-3 paragraphs explaining the idea clearly. Assume reader has read overview summary but not full docs.]

### Why It Matters
[1-2 paragraphs on significance: what problem does it solve? what capability does it unlock?]

### How It Works (High-Level)
[3-5 bullet points sketching the approach without deep implementation details]

---

## Alignment to AIM-OS Invariants

### Memory-Native IO (`CMC`)
- [X] **Relevant** — [Explain how this relates to atoms, indices, snapshots, or SEG]
- [ ] Not applicable

### Compiled Reasoning (`APOE`)
- [X] **Relevant** — [How does this affect plans, orchestration, or κ-gating?]
- [ ] Not applicable

### Verifiable Intelligence (`VIF`)
- [X] **Relevant** — [What witnesses are needed? How does lineage work?]
- [ ] Not applicable

### Atomic Evolution (`SDF-CVF`)
- [ ] **Relevant** — [Does this change how code/docs/tests/traces evolve?]
- [X] Not applicable

### Evidence Graph (`SEG`)
- [X] **Relevant** — [What graph nodes/edges are created? Time-slicing implications?]
- [ ] Not applicable

**Summary:** This idea primarily touches **[List 1-3 invariants]** with secondary implications for **[others]**.
