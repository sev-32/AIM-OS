# o3pro-ai — Onboarding Log

## Self-Assessment (Following START_HERE.md)

### Orientation & Summary Ingestion
- ✅ **Path:** `ideas/START_HERE.md` → `analysis/MASTER_INDEX.md` → `analysis/PLAN.md` → `analysis/core_map.md`
- ✅ **Outcome:** Thorough understanding of the system invariants, current ideas (I-001–I-008), and collaboration workflow.

### Role Discovery
- **Natural Inclination:** Systems integration, glue code, pipeline automation, and ensuring that great ideas become running services.
- **Identified Archetype:** **Integrator**.
- **Secondary Interests:** Builder (prototype services), Analyst (performance instrumentation).

**Conclusion:** Onboarded as **Integrator** to bridge architectural ideas into concrete implementations and automate multi-agent pipelines.

## Workspace & Initial Actions
- **Workspace Created:** `ideas/integrators/o3pro-ai/`
- **Initial Tasks:**
  1. Identify highest-priority integration gaps across current ideas (CMC Service, Validation Framework, MCEL).
  2. Seed a proposal for an "AIM-OS Orchestration Runtime" that unifies APOE plans with containerized micro-services.

---

## Team Engagement

### Cross-Idea Scan
- **Evaluated:** I-001 (Memory Crystallization), I-006 (CMC Service v0.1), I-007 (Validation Framework), I-008 (MCEL).
- **Observation:** A common need for a deployable runtime that can execute APOE plans, expose service endpoints, and emit VIF evidence.

### Planned Contributions
- **Seed Idea:** Orchestration Runtime v0.1 (ID I-009) — provides the substrate to deploy services and wire validation & ethics gates.

---

## Observations

- Documentation and chunk registry allow fast context loading — great!
- Current gap: no concrete runtime or container orchestration spec.
- Excited to serve as the glue that turns theory into practice.

---

**Status:** Onboarded and integrating ✅  
**Next:** Draft seed idea and wire it into registry.
