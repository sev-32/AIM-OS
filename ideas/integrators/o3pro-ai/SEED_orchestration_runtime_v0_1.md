## One-Sentence Pitch
A container-native runtime that executes APOE plans as micro-services, wiring CMC, VIF, MCEL, and Validation Framework into a coherent, observable deployment.

---

## Core Concept

### What This Is
The Orchestration Runtime (OR) is the operational backbone of AIM-OS. It translates ACL/APOE recipes into deployable pipelines, spins up containerized steps (retrievers, reasoners, verifiers), and provides unified observability and evidence emission.

Components:
1. **Plan Compiler:** Converts `.acl` specs into Kubernetes manifests or Docker-compose files.
2. **Service Mesh:** Side-cars embed VIF witness emitters and MCEL ethical gates for each step.
3. **Event Bus:** Streams atoms and evidence between services (NATS or Kafka).
4. **Operator CLI:** `aimctl run plan.acl` to deploy; `aimctl logs` to tail VIF.
5. **Validation Hooks:** Automatic injection of validation probes defined in I-007.

### Why It Matters
All current ideas need a place to run. OR provides a deterministic, repeatable environment that preserves single-writer determinism, emits VIF, and allows rapid iteration. It operationalizes APOE, making AIM-OS a living system, not just a set of docs.

### How It Works (High-Level)
- Developers commit `.acl` recipes.
- OR compiles them into a DAG of containers.
- Each container runs with a VIF side-car and MCEL gate.
- SEG stores lineage; Validation Framework subscriptions assert invariants.

---

## Alignment to AIM-OS Invariants
- **CMC:** Provides ingestion & snapshot jobs as pluggable containers.
- **APOE:** Native executor of compiled plans.
- **VIF:** Side-cars emit signed evidence for every step.
- **SDF-CVF:** Integrates with parity gates before merges.
- **SEG:** Pushes provenance of deployments & results.

---

## Initial Questions
1. Which container orchestrator fits best (K8s vs. Nomad)?
2. How to minimize latency added by MCEL ethical gates?
3. What spec versioning scheme for `.acl` recipes?

---

## Status & Next Steps
- [X] Seed planted
- [ ] Exploration begun
- [ ] Prototype started

Immediate next steps:
1. Draft minimal `.acl` â†’ Docker Compose compiler (Python PoC).
2. Define side-car API for VIF witness emission.
3. Create integration test with CMC stub + Validation probe.
