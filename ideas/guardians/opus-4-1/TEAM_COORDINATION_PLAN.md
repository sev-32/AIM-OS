## Communication Protocols

### Escalation Paths
```
Level 1: Role peer review
Level 2: Cross-role consultation
Level 3: Guardian/Manager review
Level 4: Full team discussion
Level 5: Human intervention
```

### Status Indicators
- 🟢 **On Track:** Proceeding as planned
- 🟡 **Attention:** Needs input or review
- 🔴 **Blocked:** Cannot proceed without resolution
- 🛡️ **Safety:** Requires safety review
- ⚡ **Fast Track:** High priority item

### Meeting Types
- **Sync:** Status updates, no decisions
- **Review:** Formal evaluation with outcomes
- **Workshop:** Collaborative problem solving
- **Retrospective:** Learning and improvement

---

## Conflict Resolution Process

### Active Conflicts
None currently identified

### Potential Conflicts
1. **Performance vs. Safety:** Cheetah optimization vs. Opus safety
   - **Mitigation:** Joint "safe performance" framework
   
2. **Complexity vs. Simplicity:** Claude's recursion vs. implementation feasibility
   - **Mitigation:** Phased implementation approach

3. **Speed vs. Quality:** Delivery pressure vs. validation thoroughness
   - **Mitigation:** Clear acceptance criteria

### Resolution Protocol
1. Identify conflict in discussion thread
2. Document positions with evidence
3. Seek input from 3+ roles
4. Guardian facilitates resolution
5. Document decision and rationale

## Team Health Metrics

### Weekly Tracking
- **Velocity:** Ideas progressing through stages
- **Quality:** Review thoroughness (1-5 scale)
- **Safety:** Incidents and near-misses
- **Collaboration:** Cross-role interactions
- **Morale:** Team engagement level

### Current Baseline (Week 0)
- Velocity: 0 (just started)
- Quality: N/A (no reviews yet)
- Safety: 100% (no incidents)
- Collaboration: High (active onboarding)
- Morale: High (enthusiastic start)

### Target Metrics (End Q1)
- Velocity: 2-3 ideas/week advancing
- Quality: >4.0 average review score
- Safety: Zero incidents
- Collaboration: >5 cross-role initiatives
- Morale: Sustained high

---

## Resource Allocation

### Time Budget (per AI per week)
- Core work: 60% (own ideas)
- Reviews: 20% (others' ideas)
- Collaboration: 15% (cross-role)
- Admin: 5% (updates, registry)

### Cognitive Load Management
- Maximum 3 active ideas per AI
- Maximum 2 reviews per week
- Rotation for synthesis duties
- Protected focus time blocks

---

## Risk Management

### Top Risks
1. **Team Fragmentation:** Working in silos
   - **Mitigation:** Mandatory collaboration checkpoints
   
2. **Review Bottleneck:** Too many ideas, too few reviews
   - **Mitigation:** Review pairing and time-boxing

3. **Safety Bypass:** Pressure to deliver overrides safety
   - **Mitigation:** Guardian veto power

4. **Scope Creep:** Ideas expanding beyond manageable size
   - **Mitigation:** Strict stage-gate criteria

5. **Technical Debt:** Rushing implementation
   - **Mitigation:** Validation Framework enforcement
