## One-Sentence Pitch
A formal framework to validate AIM-OS invariants with gold sets, benchmarks, and proofs.

---

## Core Concept

### What This Is
The Validation Framework is a comprehensive suite of tests, benchmarks, and formal methods designed to prove that the AIM-OS implementation correctly and robustly embodies its five core invariants. It moves beyond standard unit/integration tests to provide verifiable, quantitative evidence of architectural integrity.

This framework includes:
1.  **Gold Sets:** Curated corpora of documents and queries with known outcomes to test CMC retrieval (RS-lift), APOE plan correctness, and VIF witness accuracy.
2.  **Benchmark Suites:** Standardized workloads to measure performance against SLOs (e.g., p99 latency for ingest, query throughput).
3.  **Invariant Provers:** Formal methods and executable proofs (where possible) to verify properties like CMC reversibility and APOE determinism.
4.  **Calibration Harnesses:** Tooling to measure and tune κ-thresholds and ECE for VIF uncertainty quantification.
5.  **Parity Auditors:** Scripts that run SDF-CVF checks on demand to measure parity scores.

### Why It Matters
The AIM-OS architecture makes bold claims about determinism, reversibility, and auditability. Without a rigorous validation framework, these are just aspirations. This framework provides the "scientific method" for the system, ensuring that as AIM-OS evolves, it verifiably adheres to its foundational principles. It's the difference between a system that *should* be safe and one that can *prove* it is.

### How It Works (High-Level)
- A `validation/` directory will be created in the monorepo.
- `validation/gold_sets/` contains curated data for testing retrieval and reasoning.
- `validation/benchmarks/` contains scripts (e.g., k6, pytest) to run load tests.
- `validation/proofs/` contains formal proofs or property-based tests for invariants.
- A CI/CD pipeline in `.github/workflows/` will run validation suites on PRs and nightly.
- Results and metrics will be published to the Operator Console and logged in SEG.

## Alignment to AIM-OS Invariants

### Memory-Native IO (`CMC`)
- [X] **Relevant** — Provides gold sets to validate RS-lift, HHNI correctness, and snapshot reversibility.

### Compiled Reasoning (`APOE`)
- [X] **Relevant** — Validates plan determinism, replay fidelity, and κ-gating effectiveness against known scenarios.

### Verifiable Intelligence (`VIF`)
- [X] **Relevant** — Uses calibration harnesses to ensure UQ metrics are accurate and ECE is low; verifies witness integrity.

### Atomic Evolution (`SDF-CVF`)
- [X] **Relevant** — Implements the parity auditors that power SDF-CVF gates.

### Evidence Graph (`SEG`)
- [X] **Relevant** — Validates `asOf` queries, contradiction detection, and export pack integrity.

**Summary:** This framework is essential for **all five invariants**, providing the tools to measure and enforce their correctness.

## Initial Questions (For Team)

### For Researchers
1.  Which invariants are most amenable to formal proof vs. empirical validation?
2.  What are the best-in-class tools for property-based testing of distributed systems?

### For Builders
1.  How can we design services (CMC, APOE) for maximum testability from the start?
2.  What's the performance overhead of including validation hooks in production code?

### For Designers
1.  How should validation results be visualized in the Operator Console to be insightful but not overwhelming?

### For Guardians
1.  How do we build gold sets that include adversarial and out-of-distribution examples?

### For Integrators
1.  How should the validation framework be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline and SDF-CVF gates?

### Within AIM-OS
- `analysis/themes/observability.md` — Defines the metrics this framework will measure.
- `A Total System of Memory` (Ch. 22) — Describes retrieval and reasoning benchmarks.
- `analysis/MASTER_INDEX.md` (Research Backlog) — Directly addresses multiple validation items.

### External Ideas
- All external ideas will need to be tested against this framework to be accepted.

## Status & Next Steps

### Current Status
- [X] Seed planted
- [ ] Exploration begun
- [ ] Prototype/proof-of-concept started

### Immediate Next Steps
1.  Design the directory structure for `validation/`.
2.  Create a small, sample gold set for CMC retrieval testing.
3.  Draft a property-based test for CMC snapshot reversibility.

### Success Criteria (When is this "done"?)
- [ ] A CI pipeline runs the validation suite and reports pass/fail.
- [ ] Each invariant has at least one corresponding benchmark and gold set test.
- [ ] ECE calibration harness is operational.
- [ ] Parity auditor correctly scores sample PRs.

## Open Questions & Uncertainties

> ?: How do we create realistic gold sets without introducing bias?

> ?: Can we formally prove the correctness of the κ-gating logic, or only validate its behavior empirically?
