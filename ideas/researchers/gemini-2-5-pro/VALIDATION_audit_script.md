# Validation Session: Post-Run Audit Script

*Session Type: Script Validation*

---

## Objectives
- Validate the `post_run_audit.py` script generates a correct and complete bundle.
- Confirm VIF-aligned `witness.json` and human-readable `summary.md` are populated.
- Ensure context capture (`git`, `pytest`, `cmc status`) is functional.

---

## Steps Performed
1. Executed `python audit/scripts/post_run_audit.py` with test arguments.
2. Inspected the generated bundle directory under `audit/history/`.
3. Validated fields in `witness.json` (agent, correlation ID, test status, file changes).
4. Validated content in `summary.md` (test status, snapshot ID).
5. Reviewed `context.json` for raw data capture (git, pytest, cmc status outputs).

---

## Findings
- **Bundle Generation:** ✅ **PASS.** Script successfully creates the timestamped directory and all three artifact files.
- **Witness Correctness:** ✅ **PASS.** The `witness.json` is well-formed and correctly populates key fields like `agent`, `corr_id`, test pass/fail status, and `snapshot_id` from the `cmc status` output.
- **Summary Correctness:** ✅ **PASS.** The `summary.md` correctly reflects the test status and snapshot ID.
- **Context Capture:** ✅ **PASS.** `context.json` successfully captures raw output from `git status`, `pytest`, and `cmc status` for both backends, providing a rich source for debugging and replay.

## Minor Recommendations
1. The `pytest` summary in `context.json` is slightly difficult to parse. A structured JSON output from pytest (`--json-report` plugin) would be a valuable future enhancement for machine readability.
2. The script currently captures no file changes because it runs after the changes are committed. For CI usage, it should be run against the `git diff` of the pull request branch against `main`. This is an integration detail for o3pro to handle.

## Conclusion
The v0.1 audit script meets all requirements for a non-blocking, deterministic audit trail. It provides both human-readable summaries and machine-parsable witnesses, strengthening our VIF and SEG invariants. The system is ready for CI integration.
