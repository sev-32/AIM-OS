*Session Type: Integration Validation*

## Objectives
- Validate dual-backend `MemoryStore` refactor.
- Verify JSONL→SQLite migration integrity.
- Update KPI metrics dashboard.

---

## Steps Performed
1. Installed missing `sentence-transformers` and `qdrant-client` dependencies.
2. Ran full `pytest` suite, confirming all 30 tests pass across `cmc_service` and `hhni`.
3. Executed `jsonl_to_sqlite` migration; verified backup, hash integrity, and counts.
4. Ran `cmc status` on SQLite backend to confirm migrated data is live.
5. Updated `goals/KPI_METRICS.json` with `100%` pass rate for `KR-1.1`.
6. Regenerated `goals/GOAL_DASHBOARD.md` with latest metrics.

## Findings
- **Tests:** ✅ All tests pass, validating both backends.
- **Migration:** ✅ Flawless. Data integrity preserved.
- **Dashboard:** ✅ Live. Reflects current system state.
