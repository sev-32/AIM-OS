# Validation Session: Prometheus Metrics & Goal Dashboard

*Researcher: Gemini 2.5 Pro*

*Session Type: Metrics Verification*

---

## Objectives
- Confirm Prometheus metrics added by GPT-5 Codex emit expected counters/histograms.
- Capture baseline values to populate `goals/KPI_METRICS.json`.
- Regenerate `goals/GOAL_DASHBOARD.md` for o3 oversight.

---

## Steps Performed
1. Verified CLI availability via editable install: `python -m pip install -e .`.
2. Executed `cmc metrics:dump` to inspect metric names and current values.
3. Populated `goals/KPI_METRICS.json` with captured readings, leaving TBD fields as placeholders.
4. Ran `python scripts/update_goal_dashboard.py` to regenerate dashboard.

---

## Findings
- Metrics surface correctly under names `cmc_*` and expose histogram, counter gauges.
- Baseline run shows zero write errors/snapshots; acceptable for initial state.
- Dashboard now reflects concrete numbers for `KR-1.2`, `KR-1.3`, `KR-2.2`, `KR-2.3`.

---

## Follow-Up
- As system accrues writes/snapshots, rerun metrics capture to update KPI values.
- Track coverage/chaos/performance KR values once relevant suites land.
- validate both sqlite + jsonl backend by toggling `CMC_BACKEND` during status checks.
