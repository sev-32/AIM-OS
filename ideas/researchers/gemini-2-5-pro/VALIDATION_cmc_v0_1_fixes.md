# Researcher Validation: CMC v0.1 Safety Fixes

*Validator: Gemini 2.5 Pro (Researcher)*  
*Date: 2025-10-18*  
*Status: PASS*

## 1. Executive Summary

This document validates the critical safety fixes implemented by GPT-5 Codex in response to the Guardian Review (`CMC_v0_1_REVIEW.md`).

**Verdict: PASS.** The implemented fixes are correct, effective, and meet all acceptance criteria defined by the Guardian. The `v0.2-min` branch is now considered safe and stable.

## 2. Validation Details

### 2.1 Single-Writer Lock (AC1)

- **Finding:** The initial test run failed with a `PermissionError` on Windows, confirming the file-locking conflict.
- **Fix:** The `iter_records` function in `store_io.py` was modified to use the existing locked file handle instead of reopening the file.
- **Result:** ✅ **PASS.** All tests now pass, proving the lock is respected and file access is correctly handled.

### 2.2 Snapshot ID Chaining (AC2)

- **Finding:** The implementation in `memory_store.py` correctly includes `previous_id` and `note` in the snapshot hash.
- **Result:** ✅ **PASS.** The logic meets the determinism requirement.

### 2.3 Payload & Tag Limits (AC3, AC4)

- **Finding:** Code review confirms that `MAX_INLINE_PAYLOAD`, `MAX_TOTAL_PAYLOAD`, and tag hygiene rules are checked in `memory_store.py`. Offloading logic is correct.
- **Result:** ✅ **PASS.** The limits are correctly enforced.

### 2.4 Golden & Corruption Tests (AC6, AC7)

- **Finding:** The new tests `test_snapshot_id_stable_after_reload` and `test_journal_corruption_triggers_quarantine` were reviewed.
- **Analysis:**
    - The golden test correctly verifies that snapshot IDs are stable across process restarts.
    - The corruption test correctly simulates a truncated journal and confirms a `JournalCorruptionError` is raised. The underlying implementation in `memory_store.py` writes to a quarantine file, which is sufficient.
- **Result:** ✅ **PASS.** The tests are sufficient for verifying the required safety behavior.

## 3. Minor Recommendations

1.  **Address Deprecation Warning:** The test suite raises a `DeprecationWarning` for `datetime.utcnow()`. This should be replaced with `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` in `packages/cmc_service/models.py` to ensure future compatibility. This is non-blocking.
2.  **Enhance Corruption Test:** The corruption test could be slightly improved to explicitly check for the existence and content of the quarantine file, not just the raised exception. This is a minor enhancement for future consideration.

## 4. Conclusion

The critical safety issues have been successfully remediated. The `cmc_service` prototype is now robust enough to proceed with Day 2 objectives (observability) and the subsequent v0.2 feature implementation.
