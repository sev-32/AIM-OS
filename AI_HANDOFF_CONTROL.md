### Previous Activities:
**Date:** 2025-10-18
**AI:** Opus 4.1 (Guardian)
**Task:** CMC v0.1 Safety Review
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete - Fixes Required

---

## üéØ RECOMMENDED NEXT ACTION

### For Braden (Right Now):
Phase 1 safety fixes are complete and validated. Time for Phase 2: Observability.

#### ‚úÖ APPROVED: Day 2 Observability Implementation
**Switch to:** GPT-5 Codex
**Prompt:** (Guardian-approved, ready to copy/paste)
```
Continue AIM-OS development as Builder. Read:
- AI_HANDOFF_CONTROL.md (this file)
- ideas/guardians/opus-4-1/CMC_v0_1_REVIEW.md
- ideas/researchers/gemini-2-5-pro/VALIDATION_cmc_v0_1_fixes.md

Implement v0.2-min in packages/cmc_service with focus on observability + UTC:
1) Structured JSON logging with correlation_id:
   - Add logs for: create_atom, list_atoms, create_snapshot, replay_snapshot, startup load.
   - Schema: { ts (RFC3339, UTC), level, action, correlation_id, atom_id?, snapshot_id?, count?, duration_ms?, path?, error? }.
   - CLI: add --correlation-id (optional); default to UUID4 if not provided.
   - Emit to stdout via stdlib logging (JSON formatter). If structlog available, use it; otherwise keep stdlib.

2) Minimal counters + improved status:
   - In-process counters: atoms_created_total{modality}, snapshots_created_total, write_errors_total.
   - Snapshot duration histogram (simple bucketed stats in-process; Prometheus optional as extra).
   - `cmc status` prints: atom count (cached), last snapshot id/time, journal integrity check result, counters summary.

3) UTC standardization:
   - Replace datetime.utcnow() with datetime.now(timezone.utc).
   - Ensure _isoformat/_parse_datetime keep/accept `Z` and reflect UTC everywhere.

4) Documentation:
   - Update packages/cmc_service/README.md with: size limits (1MB inline, 100MB total/offload), tag hygiene (max 20, key<=50, weight in [0,1]), snapshot ID chaining (includes previous_id, note), logging schema, status output.

5) Tests:
   - Keep existing tests green (golden determinism, corruption quarantine).
   - Add a minimal log test that runs a snapshot create with a fixed correlation_id and asserts a JSON log line contains that id and action.

Acceptance (do not proceed until met):
- AC5: Structured JSON logs present with correlation_id on atom/snapshot actions.
- AC1‚ÄìAC4, AC6‚ÄìAC7 remain passing after changes.

Run: .venv\Scripts\pytest
```

### My Recommendation:
Proceed with GPT-5 Codex to complete the `v0.2-min` stabilization work.

## üö¶ HANDOFF STATUS INDICATORS

### Current System State:
- üü¢ **Development Active** - AIs can work independently
- üü¢ **Handoffs Ready** - You can switch anytime
- üü¢ **Safety Engaged** - All work being reviewed
- üü¢ **Progress Tracking** - Everything logged

### When You Need to Act:
- üü° **Design Review** - When UI mockups are needed
- üî¥ **Blocked** - If an AI reports a blocker here
- üõë **Safety Issue** - Immediate attention required

---

## üí° PRO TIPS

1. **You don't need to handoff in order** - Call any AI anytime
2. **AIs will continue working** - Even without explicit handoffs
3. **Use Opus 4.1 as default** - For status checks and coordination
4. **Check BRADEN_STATUS_UPDATE.md** - For simple English updates
5. **The system is self-organizing** - It works even when you're away

---

**Role:** Progress tracking, handoff orchestration, and concise status reporting  
**Current Focus:** Execute v0.2-min handoffs (observability), align reviews, and keep prompts ready.

### Targeted Handoff Prompts (Copy/Paste)

‚Äî GPT-5 Codex (Builder)
```
Continue AIM-OS as Builder. Implement v0.2-min for CMC: (1) structured JSON logs with correlation_id + basic counters and improved `cmc status`, (2) standardize UTC handling, (3) update README with enforced limits/offload, (4) optionally scaffold TS client. Keep tests green and update VALIDATION doc.
```

‚Äî Gemini 2.5 Pro (Researcher)
```
Continue AIM-OS as Researcher. Review CMC v0.2-min observability changes. Specify and validate JSON log schema + minimal counters; extend corruption test to assert quarantine artifacts. Update VALIDATION report with findings and acceptance for AC5.
```

‚Äî Opus 4.1 (Guardian)
```
As Guardian, perform CMC v0.2 gate review. Verify AC5 (structured logs + correlation IDs), UTC standardization, and docs updated. Reconfirm AC1‚ÄìAC7. Record decision in ideas/guardians/opus-4-1/CMC_v0_2_GATE_REVIEW.md.
```

‚Äî Claude 4.5 (Architect)
```
Continue AIM-OS as Architect. Sync CMC v0.2 blueprint with finalized snapshot chaining, logging/counters, and UTC standards. Specify how APOE/VIF/SEG will consume correlation IDs and witness fields. Flag any new ADRs needed.

### Targeted Prompts (Copy/Paste)

‚Äî o3pro-ai (Main Manager)
```
Act as Main Manager. Review AI_HANDOFF_CONTROL.md and current CMC v0.2-min status. Set sprint priorities (SQLite migration start, metrics export choice, HHNI L0‚ÄìL2 scope) and post decisions + blockers to TEAM_INFRASTRUCTURE.md and TEAM_SCHEDULE.md.
```

‚Äî Opus 4.1 (Coding Assistant Manager)
```
Coordinate coding efforts. Verify AC5 (logs/UTC) and green-light v0.2 blueprint execution. Help sequence Claude‚Äôs v0.2 tasks and Codex implementation tickets. Record gate decision in ideas/guardians/opus-4-1/CMC_v0_2_GATE_REVIEW.md.

```

‚Äî GPT-5 Codex (Assistant Coder)
```
Support Main Coder. Implement tickets authored by Claude for v0.2: start SQLite schema/migration script, wire status and logging to DB path, and scaffold HHNI L0. Keep tests green and update VALIDATION doc with any new acceptance cases.
