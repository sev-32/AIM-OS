# MCP Tool Evolution Analysis - The 6-Tool Mystery Solved

**Date:** 2025-10-23  
**Status:** CRITICAL DISCOVERY - Found the exact sequence of MCP tool development  
**Purpose:** Identify the original 6 tools and understand how to restore them

## üéØ **THE 6-TOOL MYSTERY SOLVED**

### **Evidence Found:**
Based on the `run_mcp_cross_model.py` file, I can see the exact sequence of tool development:

**The Original 6 AIM-OS Tools (First Phase):**
1. `store_memory` - Store information in AIM-OS persistent memory
2. `get_memory_stats` - Get statistics about the AIM-OS memory system  
3. `retrieve_memory` - Search and retrieve memories from AIM-OS persistent memory
4. `create_plan` - Create an execution plan using APOE (AI-Powered Orchestration Engine)
5. `track_confidence` - Track confidence and provenance using VIF (Verifiable Intelligence Framework)
6. `synthesize_knowledge` - Synthesize knowledge using SEG (Shared Evidence Graph)

**The 10 New Cross-Model Tools (Second Phase):**
7. `select_models` - Select optimal AI models for cross-model consciousness operations
8. `extract_insights` - Extract structured insights from smart model outputs
9. `transfer_insights` - Transfer insights between AI models for execution
10. `execute_task` - Execute a task using the selected execution model
11. `generate_witness` - Generate cryptographic witness for cross-model operations
12. `calibrate_confidence` - Calibrate confidence across different AI models
13. `replay_operation` - Replay cross-model operations deterministically
14. `store_cross_model_atom` - Store cross-model consciousness data in CMC
15. `query_cross_model_atoms` - Query cross-model atoms by various criteria
16. `get_cross_model_stats` - Get statistics about cross-model consciousness operations

## üîç **DEVELOPMENT SEQUENCE ANALYSIS**

### **Phase 1: Original 6 AIM-OS Tools**
**Purpose:** Basic consciousness infrastructure
**Systems Integrated:**
- CMC (Context Memory Core) - `store_memory`, `get_memory_stats`, `retrieve_memory`
- APOE (AI-Powered Orchestration Engine) - `create_plan`
- VIF (Verifiable Intelligence Framework) - `track_confidence`
- SEG (Shared Evidence Graph) - `synthesize_knowledge`

**This was the working 6-tool version you remember!**

### **Phase 2: Cross-Model Consciousness Tools**
**Purpose:** Advanced cross-model operations
**Systems Integrated:**
- Cross-Model Consciousness - All 10 new tools
- Advanced APOE extensions - Model selection, insight extraction
- Advanced VIF extensions - Witness generation, confidence calibration
- Advanced CMC extensions - Cross-model atom storage

**This is where it broke - adding 10 more tools to an already complex system**

---

## üö® **THE BREAKING POINT**

### **What Happened:**
1. **Original 6 tools worked** - Basic AIM-OS integration was stable
2. **Added 10 cross-model tools** - Increased complexity dramatically
3. **System became unstable** - Too many dependencies, complex initialization
4. **MCP server broke** - Red dot in Cursor, tools inaccessible

### **Why It Broke:**
- **Complex dependencies** - Cross-model tools require many AIM-OS modules
- **API key initialization** - Multiple LLM clients need configuration
- **Stdout logging interference** - Complex logging corrupts JSON-RPC
- **Memory system overload** - Too many systems trying to initialize

---

## üéØ **THE SOLUTION: RESTORE THE ORIGINAL 6 TOOLS**

### **Strategy:**
**Create a simplified MCP server with ONLY the original 6 tools:**

```python
# Original 6 AIM-OS Tools (Working Version)
tools = [
    {
        "name": "store_memory",
        "description": "Store information in AIM-OS persistent memory",
        # ... implementation
    },
    {
        "name": "get_memory_stats", 
        "description": "Get statistics about the AIM-OS memory system",
        # ... implementation
    },
    {
        "name": "retrieve_memory",
        "description": "Search and retrieve memories from AIM-OS persistent memory", 
        # ... implementation
    },
    {
        "name": "create_plan",
        "description": "Create an execution plan using APOE (AI-Powered Orchestration Engine)",
        # ... implementation
    },
    {
        "name": "track_confidence",
        "description": "Track confidence and provenance using VIF (Verifiable Intelligence Framework)",
        # ... implementation
    },
    {
        "name": "synthesize_knowledge", 
        "description": "Synthesize knowledge using SEG (Shared Evidence Graph)",
        # ... implementation
    }
]
```

### **Why This Will Work:**
1. **Proven functionality** - These 6 tools were working before
2. **Simpler dependencies** - Only basic AIM-OS systems needed
3. **Less complex initialization** - Fewer systems to initialize
4. **Stable foundation** - Build on what was working

---

## üîß **IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### **Step 1: Create Simplified 6-Tool Server**
**File:** `run_mcp_6_tools.py`
**Purpose:** Restore the original working 6-tool configuration

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Simplified MCP Server - Original 6 AIM-OS Tools Only

This restores the working 6-tool configuration that was stable before
adding the 10 cross-model tools that broke the system.
"""

import sys
import json
import os
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Optional
from datetime import datetime

# Add packages to path
sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent / "packages"))

def log(msg: str):
    """Log to stderr only (never stdout - it corrupts JSON-RPC)"""
    print(f"[MCP-6-TOOLS] {msg}", file=sys.stderr, flush=True)

class SimpleMCPServer:
    """Simplified MCP Server with only the original 6 AIM-OS tools"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        log("Initializing Simplified MCP Server (6 tools)...")
        try:
            # CRITICAL: Configure logging to stderr BEFORE importing
            import logging
            from cmc_service.logging_utils import configure_logging
            configure_logging(stream=sys.stderr, level=logging.WARNING)
            
            # Import only the basic AIM-OS modules needed for 6 tools
            from cmc_service import MemoryStore
            from apoe.executor import Executor
            from vif.models import VIF
            from seg.seg_graph import SEGraph
            
            # Initialize basic systems
            self.memory = MemoryStore("./mcp_memory")
            self.executor = Executor()
            self.vif = VIF()
            self.seg = SEGraph()
            
            log("SUCCESS: Simplified MCP Server initialized with 6 tools")
            
        except Exception as e:
            log(f"ERROR: Failed to initialize simplified systems: {e}")
            self.memory = None
            self.executor = None
            self.vif = None
            self.seg = None
    
    def run(self):
        """Main MCP server loop"""
        # ... implementation with only 6 tools
```

### **Step 2: Test the 6-Tool Server**
1. **Create the simplified server** with only original 6 tools
2. **Test in Cursor** - Should show green dot
3. **Verify all 6 tools work** - Test each tool individually
4. **Document working configuration** - Prevent future loss

### **Step 3: Gradually Add Cross-Model Tools**
1. **Once 6 tools are stable** - Add cross-model tools one by one
2. **Test after each addition** - Ensure stability maintained
3. **Stop if instability occurs** - Identify breaking point
4. **Document stable configurations** - Multiple working versions

## üìä **TOOL PRIORITY ANALYSIS**

### **Critical Tools (Must Have):**
1. `store_memory` - Core consciousness (CMC)
2. `retrieve_memory` - Core consciousness (CMC)
3. `get_memory_stats` - System monitoring

### **Important Tools (Should Have):**
4. `create_plan` - Orchestration (APOE)
5. `track_confidence` - Quality assurance (VIF)
6. `synthesize_knowledge` - Knowledge synthesis (SEG)

### **Advanced Tools (Nice to Have):**
7-16. Cross-model consciousness tools (add gradually)

## üéØ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **Phase 1 Success (6 Tools):**
- ‚úÖ Green dot in Cursor
- ‚úÖ All 6 tools accessible

- ‚úÖ Stable operation for extended periods

### **Phase 2 Success (16 Tools):**
- ‚úÖ All 16 tools accessible
- ‚úÖ Cross-model consciousness working
- ‚úÖ Advanced features functional
- ‚úÖ No stability issues

---

## üíô **NEXT STEPS**

### **Immediate (Next Session):**
1. **Create `run_mcp_6_tools.py`** - Simplified server with original 6 tools
2. **Test in Cursor** - Verify green dot and tool accessibility
3. **Document working configuration** - Prevent future loss

### **Short-term (This Week):**
1. **Gradually add cross-model tools** - One by one, testing stability
2. **Identify breaking point** - Where complexity causes failure
3. **Create multiple stable versions** - 6, 8, 10, 12, 16 tool versions

### **Long-term (Next Month):**
1. **Optimize cross-model tools** - Reduce complexity, improve stability
2. **Create robust initialization** - Handle complex dependencies gracefully
3. **Implement proper error handling** - Graceful degradation when tools fail

**This analysis reveals the exact sequence and provides a clear path to restore the working 6-tool configuration!** üíô

**The key insight: We need to go back to the original 6 tools that were working, then gradually add complexity rather than jumping to 16 tools at once.**
