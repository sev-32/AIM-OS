```python
# Start monitoring with context getter
dumping_system.start_monitoring(context_getter)

# Automatic alerts when approaching limits
# - 85% capacity: Selective dump recommended
# - 95% capacity: Emergency dump required
# - Time threshold: Incremental dump recommended
# - Quality threshold: Compressed dump recommended

# Get current status
status = dumping_system.get_context_usage_status()
```

### **3. Integrated Context Management**
```python
# Start integrated context management
context_manager.start_context_management(context_getter)

# Configure context management
context_manager.configure_context_management(
    mode=ContextManagerMode.AUTOMATIC,
    max_tokens=128000,
    capacity_thresholds={
        'warning': 0.70,
        'critical': 0.85,
        'emergency': 0.95
    },
    auto_dump_enabled=True,
