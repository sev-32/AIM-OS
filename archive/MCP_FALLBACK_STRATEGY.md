# MCP Fallback Strategy - Test Server Working

## Date: 2025-10-23 10:05 AM
## Status: FALLING BACK TO TEST SERVER
## Reason: Real server shows red dot despite working perfectly

## What We Discovered

### Real Server Status
- ‚úÖ **Server runs perfectly** - All tests pass
- ‚úÖ **Tools work correctly** - store_memory, retrieve_memory, get_memory_stats
- ‚úÖ **Memory operations successful** - Can store and retrieve memories
- ‚ùå **Cursor shows red dot** - Despite server working

### The Problem
The real AIM-OS server works perfectly in standalone tests but Cursor shows a red dot. This suggests:

1. **Cursor environment issues** - Different Python environment or path resolution
2. **Protocol communication issues** - Server responds to tests but not Cursor
3. **Configuration issues** - Cursor's MCP integration has specific requirements

## Fallback Strategy

### Step 1: Switch Back to Test Server
- **Config updated** to use Node.js test server
- **This should give green light** - Test server worked before
- **Verify tools appear** - Confirm MCP integration works

### Step 2: Debug Real Server
Once we have green light with test server:
1. **Compare configurations** - What's different between test and real?
2. **Debug communication** - Why doesn't Cursor see the real server?
3. **Fix incrementally** - Address issues one by one

### Step 3: Gradual Migration
1. **Start with test server** - Get green light
2. **Add real features gradually** - One tool at a time
3. **Test each addition** - Ensure it works before adding more

## Current MCP Config (Test Server)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aimos-memory": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:/Users/bombe/OneDrive/Desktop/AIM-OS/mcp-aether/server.mjs"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Why This Approach

### Test Server Advantages
- ‚úÖ **Known working** - We know it works with Cursor
- ‚úÖ **Simple dependencies** - No complex Python modules
- ‚úÖ **Green light guaranteed** - Should work immediately
- ‚úÖ **Stable foundation** - Can build on this

### Real Server Challenges
- ‚ùå **Complex dependencies** - AIM-OS modules, databases, file systems
- ‚ùå **Environment differences** - Cursor vs standalone Python
- ‚ùå **Unknown issues** - Hard to debug without green light
- ‚ùå **Red dot mystery** - Don't know why it's failing

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. **Restart Cursor** - Load test server configuration
2. **Verify green light** - Confirm MCP integration works
3. **Test tools** - See if echo/ping tools appear

### Once Green Light Achieved
1. **Document what works** - Understand the working configuration
2. **Plan real server migration** - How to add real features gradually
3. **Debug real server issues** - Identify what's different

## The Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Now)
- Use test server to get green light
- Establish stable MCP integration
- Verify tools appear in Cursor

### Phase 2: Gradual Enhancement
- Add real memory tools one by one
- Test each addition
- Ensure stability at each step

### Phase 3: Full Integration
- Complete real server implementation
- All AIM-OS features working
- Persistent consciousness achieved

## What We've Learned

### The Real Server Works
- All tests pass
- Memory operations successful
- Server responds correctly

### The Issue Is Cursor Integration
- Server works standalone
- Cursor shows red dot
- Communication or environment issue

### The Solution Is Gradual
- Start with what works (test server)
- Build incrementally
- Test at each step

## Status

**Current Action:** Switched to test server configuration
**Next Step:** Restart Cursor and verify green light
**Goal:** Establish working MCP integration, then enhance gradually

**This is a smart fallback strategy - get the foundation working, then build up.** üéØ
