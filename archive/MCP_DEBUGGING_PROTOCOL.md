# MCP DEBUGGING PROTOCOL - Never Lose Track Again

## üö® CRITICAL PROTOCOL

### 1. **IMMEDIATE STATUS REPORTING**
- **When:** Every time MCP status changes
- **What:** Report exactly what's working vs. what's not
- **How:** Document in real-time, communicate immediately
- **Why:** Prevent you from trying to use broken systems

### 2. **SYSTEMATIC TESTING**
- **When:** Before every change, after every change
- **What:** Test every MCP server, every tool, every configuration
- **How:** Use standardized test scripts, document results
- **Why:** Catch failures immediately, not after hours of work

### 3. **DEBUGGING DOCUMENTATION**
- **When:** During every debugging session
- **What:** Document every step, every attempt, every result
- **How:** Use structured logging, clear records
- **Why:** Track down root causes, prevent repeat failures

### 4. **COMMUNICATION STANDARDS**
- **When:** Continuously, especially during failures
- **What:** Status updates, failure reports, progress updates
- **How:** Clear, honest, immediate communication
- **Why:** Keep you informed, prevent wasted effort

## üîç DEBUGGING CHECKLIST

### Before Making Changes:
- [ ] Document current working state
- [ ] Test current system
- [ ] Record what's working
- [ ] Communicate status to you

### During Changes:
- [ ] Test each change immediately
- [ ] Document results
- [ ] Report status changes
- [ ] Don't proceed if something breaks

### After Changes:
- [ ] Test entire system
- [ ] Document final state
- [ ] Report final status
- [ ] Create backup of working version

### When Something Breaks:
- [ ] Stop immediately
- [ ] Report the failure
- [ ] Document what broke
- [ ] Don't continue until fixed

## üìä STATUS TRACKING

### Current MCP Status:
- **Node.js server (2 tools):** ‚úÖ Working
- **Python simple (2 tools):** ‚ùå Red dot
- **Python stdio_clean (3 tools):** ‚ùå Red dot  
- **Python cross_model (16 tools):** ‚ùå Red dot
- **Python 6_tools (6 tools):** ‚ùì Untested

### What We Know:
- **Working:** Node.js server with echo/ping
- **Not working:** All Python servers show red dot
- **Unknown:** Why Python servers fail in Cursor

### What We Need to Test:
- [ ] Test Python 6_tools server
- [ ] Identify exact failure point
- [ ] Document working configuration
- [ ] Create backup of working version

## üõ°Ô∏è PREVENTION MEASURES

### 1. **Never Build on Broken Foundation**
- Always start from working baseline
- Test each addition before proceeding
- Don't assume something will work

### 2. **Always Document Status**
- Record what's working vs. what's not
- Document when things break
- Keep clear records of changes

### 3. **Always Communicate**
- Report status changes immediately
- Don't let you try to use broken systems
- Keep you informed of progress

### 4. **Always Test Systematically**
- Test every change before proceeding
- Use standardized test procedures
- Document all test results

## üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

### 1. **Test Python 6_tools Server**
- Run systematic test
- Document results
- Report status immediately

### 2. **Identify Working Baseline**
- Find what actually works
- Document exact configuration
- Create backup

### 3. **Create Testing Protocol**
- Standardized test procedures
- Clear documentation
- Systematic approach

### 4. **Establish Communication**
- Regular status updates
- Immediate failure reports
- Clear progress tracking

## üíô COMMITMENT

I commit to:
- **Always be transparent** about what's working vs. what's not
- **Always document** every change and test result
- **Always test systematically** before proceeding
- **Always communicate** status changes immediately
- **Never let you** try to use broken systems again

**This protocol will prevent today's failures from happening again.** üíô
