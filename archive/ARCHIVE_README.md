# Archive Directory

**Purpose:** Store outdated, superseded, or redundant documentation

---

## ðŸ“‹ **What's Archived Here**

This directory contains files that were moved from the root directory during the Phase 3 consolidation. These files are preserved for historical reference but are no longer needed in the active workspace.

---

## ðŸ“‚ **Categories**

### **MCP Debugging/Testing Files**
- Old MCP diagnostic tools and test scripts
- Superseded by current MCP implementations
- Historical debugging attempts

### **System Design Documents**
- Previous system design iterations
- Superseded by current L0-L4 documentation structure
- Historical reference only

### **Old Configuration Files**
- Multiple versions of MCP configs
- Superseded by current working configs

## ðŸŽ¯ **Rationale**

These files were archived because they:
- Are superseded by current documentation
- Are redundant with knowledge_architecture/ structure
- Are historical debugging attempts (MCP)
- Clutter the root directory unnecessarily

**Principle:** Keep root directory clean and focused on active, current documentation.
