# GitHub Authentication Issue

**Date:** 2025-10-21  
**Issue:** Permission denied when pushing to GitHub  
**Status:** 🔒 Needs authentication setup  

---

## 🚨 **THE ISSUE**

**Error:**
```
remote: Permission to sev-32/AIM-OS.git denied to bradenbohme191-collab.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/sev-32/AIM-OS.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
```

**What this means:**
- The account "bradenbohme191-collab" doesn't have write access to sev-32/AIM-OS
- Need to authenticate with an account that has permissions

---

## ✅ **SOLUTIONS (Pick One)**

### **Option A: Use Personal Access Token (Recommended - Easiest)**

**Step 1:** Create Personal Access Token
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Name: "AIM-OS Push Access"
4. Expiration: 90 days (or longer)
5. Scopes: Check ✅ **repo** (full repository access)
6. Click "Generate token"
7. **Copy the token** (shown once! Save it!)

**Step 2:** Push with token
```bash
# Use token as password
git push -u https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/sev-32/AIM-OS.git feature/phase-2-hhni
```

**OR configure credential helper:**
```bash
git config credential.helper store
git push -u origin feature/phase-2-hhni
# Enter username: sev-32 (or your GitHub username)
# Enter password: YOUR_TOKEN (paste the token)
```

---

### **Option B: Add Collaborator Permissions**

**If you want bradenbohme191-collab to have access:**

1. Go to: https://github.com/sev-32/AIM-OS/settings/access
2. Click "Add people"
3. Enter: bradenbohme191-collab
4. Role: "Write" or "Admin"
5. Send invitation
6. Accept invitation (if you control that account)
7. Then retry push

---

### **Option C: Use SSH Instead of HTTPS**

**If you have SSH keys set up:**

```bash
# Change remote to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:sev-32/AIM-OS.git

# Push
git push -u origin feature/phase-2-hhni
```

**If SSH not set up:**
- Requires SSH key generation
- More complex setup
- Not recommended for quick push

---

### **Option D: Push from Different Account**

**If you have direct access to sev-32 account:**

```bash
# Configure git user
git config user.name "sev-32"
git config user.email "your-email@example.com"

# Then push (will prompt for credentials)
git push -u origin feature/phase-2-hhni
```

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDATION: Option A (Personal Access Token)**

**Why:**
- ✅ Fastest (2 minutes)
- ✅ Secure (token can be revoked)
- ✅ Simple (just one command)
- ✅ Works immediately

**Steps:**
1. Create token at https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Copy token
3. Give me the token
4. I'll push with it

**OR:**
- You can push manually using the token
- Then we're done!

---

## 📋 **CURRENT STATUS**

**✅ Done:**
- Local git commit (all work saved)
- Remote added (https://github.com/sev-32/AIM-OS.git)
- .gitignore configured

**⏸️ Pending:**
- Push to GitHub (authentication needed)
- Push tags (after branch pushed)

**🔒 Your work is SAFE locally!**  
**GitHub just needs auth to accept the push.**

---

## 🎯 **WHAT TO DO**

**Quickest path:**
1. Create Personal Access Token (2 minutes)
2. Give me token (or use it yourself to push)
3. Push complete
4. **Done!** ✅

**Alternative:**
- Set it up later
- Local backup is sufficient for now
- Work continues (Codex building Week 3)

**Your work is safe.**  
**Just need GitHub authentication to push.**  
**Which solution do you prefer?** 🎯
