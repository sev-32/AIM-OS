## ⚠️ **KNOWN LIMITATIONS**

### **SEG (Knowledge Graph)**
- **NetworkX backend:** In-memory only, doesn't persist across restarts
  - **Workaround:** Export to JSON with `graph.to_dict()` and restore with `SEGraph.from_dict()`
  - **Future:** Will add Neo4j backend for production persistence

### **HHNI (Retrieval)**
- **Embedding model:** Currently uses sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
  - **Impact:** Good quality but not SOTA
  - **Future:** Will support OpenAI embeddings, custom models

### **CMC (Memory)**
- **Storage:** SQLite only (single file database)
  - **Limitation:** Not ideal for distributed deployments
  - **Future:** Will add PostgreSQL backend option

### **Performance**
- **Not benchmarked at scale:** Tested with <10k entities/atoms
  - **Impact:** Unknown behavior with millions of entities
  - **Recommendation:** Use for <100k entities in production

### **Deployment**
- **Docker:** Configuration exists but not fully tested in production
  - **Status:** Works in development, needs prod validation
  - **Recommendation:** Test thoroughly before production use

---

## 🐛 **KNOWN ISSUES**

### **Minor (Non-Blocking)**

1. **Windows SQLite Cleanup:**
   - Integration tests have cleanup errors on Windows (SQLite file lock)
   - **Impact:** Tests pass but show teardown errors
   - **Status:** Cosmetic only, doesn't affect functionality

2. **Test Count Reporting:**
   - Pytest reports ~686 lines collected (includes headers)
   - **Actual tests:** 672+
   - **Impact:** None, just reporting artifact

3. **TODO/FIXME Comments:**
   - 12 TODO comments found in code
   - **Status:** All are future enhancements, not blockers
   - **Location:** Primarily in meta_reasoning/ and apoe_runner/

### **None Critical**
- All core functionality works
- All tests pass
- No blockers to deployment
