## 🟡 PART 2: WHAT'S IN PROGRESS

### **System 7: SEG - Shared Evidence Graph**
```yaml
Status: 10% (skeleton only, needs implementation)
Tests: 0 (none yet)
Files: 2 files (just __init__.py and witness.py stub)
Location: packages/seg/

What Exists:
  ⚪ Basic package structure
  ⚪ Documentation (L1-L4 complete, but no code)
  ⚪ witness.py (empty stub)

What's Missing (CRITICAL PATH):
  ❌ Graph backend choice (NetworkX? Neo4j? RDFLib?)
  ❌ Core graph schema (Entity, Relation, Evidence nodes)
  ❌ Time-slice queries (query graph at any time)
  ❌ Contradiction detection (find conflicts)
  ❌ Export/import functionality
  ❌ CMC integration (graph feeds from memory)
  ❌ Comprehensive tests (target: 30-40 tests)
  ❌ README.md (implementation guide)
  ❌ Complete exports in __init__.py

Estimated Work:
  8-10 hours of focused implementation
  Confidence: 0.80 (after backend choice)
  
Blocking Decision:
  Q004: Which graph backend?
    Option A: NetworkX (simple, Python-native, good for MVP)
    Option B: Neo4j (powerful, but requires server)
    Option C: RDFLib (semantic web, more complex)
    
  Recommendation: NetworkX for MVP
    - Simple to use
    - No server required
    - Good performance for moderate graphs
    - Easy to migrate later if needed
```

---

## ❌ PART 3: WHAT'S MISSING (GAPS)

### **SEG Implementation (Highest Priority)**
```yaml
Priority: CRITICAL (only unfinished system)
Time: 8-10 hours
Confidence: 0.80

Tasks:
  1. Choose graph backend (NetworkX recommended)
  2. Implement core schema:
     - Entity nodes (with bitemporal versioning)
     - Relation edges (typed relationships)
     - Evidence nodes (supporting data)
  3. Build time-slice queries:
     - query_at(timestamp) - Graph state at time
     - detect_contradictions() - Find conflicts
     - trace_provenance(entity) - Complete lineage
  4. CMC integration:
     - Atoms feed into graph
     - Graph queries use CMC memory
  5. Add 30-40 comprehensive tests
  6. Complete documentation (README, exports)
```

### **Extended Integration Testing**
```yaml
Priority: HIGH (validate everything works together)
Time: 2-3 hours
Confidence: 0.85

Current: 42 integration tests
Target: 60-70 integration tests

Missing Tests:
  ❌ CMC+SEG integration (memory → knowledge graph)
  ❌ APOE+SEG integration (orchestration uses graph)
  ❌ SEG+VIF integration (graph with provenance)
  ❌ Complete 7-system end-to-end workflows
  ❌ Performance benchmarks (actual throughput)
  ❌ Load testing (concurrent operations)
  ❌ Stress testing (large datasets)

New Test Files Needed:
  - test_cmc_seg_integration.py
  - test_apoe_seg_integration.py
  - test_seg_vif_integration.py
  - test_full_system_workflow.py
  - test_performance_benchmarks.py
```

### **Production Preparation**
```yaml
Priority: HIGH (needed for ship)
Time: 3-5 hours
Confidence: 0.70

Missing Infrastructure:
  ❌ Docker Compose (multi-service deployment)
  ❌ Environment configuration (.env template)
  ❌ Logging/monitoring setup (structured logs)
  ❌ Backup/restore procedures
  ❌ Deployment guide (step-by-step)
  ❌ Health check endpoints
  ❌ Graceful shutdown handling

Files to Create:
  - docker-compose.yml (complete, not just skeleton)
  - .env.template (all configuration options)
  - deploy/monitoring.yml (observability)
  - deploy/backup.sh (automated backups)
  - docs/DEPLOYMENT.md (deployment guide)
  - docs/MONITORING.md (observability guide)
```

### **Documentation Updates**
```yaml
Priority: MEDIUM (polish before ship)
Time: 1-2 hours
Confidence: 0.95

Needs Update:
  ❌ Main README.md (add SEG when complete)
  ❌ PROJECT_STATUS.md (update to 100% when done)
  ❌ Verify all L1-L4 docs match code (audit)
  ❌ Create RELEASE_NOTES.md (what's included)
  ❌ Update GOAL_TREE.yaml (mark objectives complete)

Minor Gaps:
  ⚠️ Some component READMEs could be more detailed
  ⚠️ A few L3 docs don't have all code examples
  ⚠️ Missing "Troubleshooting" sections in some docs
```

### **Code Quality Cleanup**
```yaml
Priority: LOW (nice to have)
Time: 1-2 hours
Confidence: 0.90

Known Issues:
  ⚠️ 12 TODO/FIXME comments found (review each)
    - packages/apoe_runner/executor.py (1 TODO)
    - packages/meta_reasoning/thought_articulator.py (11 TODOs)
  
  ✅ Datetime warnings: FIXED (completed today)
  
  ⚠️ Some function docstrings could be more detailed
  ⚠️ A few type hints could be more precise
  
Action:
  - Review all 12 TODOs (determine if blockers or polish)
  - Add missing docstrings where important
  - Consider stricter type checking (optional)
```
