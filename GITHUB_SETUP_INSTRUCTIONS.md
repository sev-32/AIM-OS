## 🎯 **GITHUB SETUP (3 Steps)**

### **Step 1: Create GitHub Repository**

**Go to:** https://github.com/new

**Settings:**
- **Repository name:** `AIM-OS` (or whatever you prefer)
- **Description:** "AI-Native Operating System - Cognitive substrate for AGI"
- **Visibility:** 
  - **Private** (recommended for now - keep proprietary)
  - OR Public (if you want to share)
- **Initialize:** 
  - ❌ DON'T check "Add README" (we have one)
  - ❌ DON'T add .gitignore (we have one)
  - ❌ DON'T add license (unless you want to)

**Click:** "Create repository"

**Copy the URL shown (will look like):**
- HTTPS: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AIM-OS.git`
- SSH: `git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/AIM-OS.git`

---

### **Step 2: Add GitHub Remote**

**In terminal (I can do this once you give me the URL):**

```bash
# Add remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AIM-OS.git

# Verify
git remote -v
```

---

### **Step 3: Push to GitHub**

**Push current branch:**
```bash
git push -u origin feature/phase-2-hhni
```

**Push tags (milestones):**
```bash
git push --tags
```

**This pushes:**
- phase-1-mvp-complete (tag)
- baseline-pre-self-improve-001 (tag)
- feature/phase-2-hhni (branch with all work)

---

## 📊 **WHAT GETS BACKED UP TO GITHUB**

**Code (~5000 lines):**
- Complete HHNI implementation (1500+ lines)
- CMC service (1000+ lines)
- APOE runner
- Orchestration builder
- All other packages
- All tests (50+ passing)

**Documentation (~15,000 lines):**
- analysis/ (design, themes, plan - UPDATED today)
- Documentation/ (architecture docs - 5 new)

## 🎯 **ONGOING BACKUP STRATEGY**

### **When to Commit:**
- After each task completion
- After significant work session
- Before major changes
- **At least daily**

### **Commit Message Format:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat(component): brief description

Details:
- What was added/changed
- Why it matters
- Tests passing
- Key metrics

Evidence: path/to/files"
```

### **When to Push:**
- After each commit (safest)
- End of each day (minimum)
- After milestones
- **Regular cadence**

---

## 🔒 **BACKUP BENEFITS**

### **With GitHub:**
- ✅ Remote backup (safe from local failures)
- ✅ Version history (can see evolution)
- ✅ Easy sharing (send link to other AIs)
- ✅ Collaboration (multiple contributors)
- ✅ Issues/Projects (task tracking)
- ✅ Actions/CI (automated testing)
- ✅ Professional presentation

### **For Showing Other AIs:**
- Send GitHub URL
- They can browse code
- They can read documentation
- They can see commit history
- They can understand evolution
- **Perfect for collaboration** ✅

## 🎯 **NEXT STEPS**

### **You Need To Do:**
1. Go to github.com/new
2. Create repository (name: "AIM-OS" or your choice)
3. Choose Private or Public
4. Copy the repository URL
5. Give me the URL

### **Then I'll Do:**
1. Add remote to your git config
2. Push all branches
3. Push all tags
4. Verify everything backed up

### **Then You Have:**
- ✅ Local backup (git)
- ✅ Remote backup (GitHub)
- ✅ Shareable URL
- ✅ Professional presence
- ✅ **Fully protected work** 🛡️

## 📋 **CURRENT STATUS**

**✅ Done:**
- Updated .gitignore (proper Python excludes)
- Staged all important files
- Created comprehensive commit (b9d8acb)
- Local backup complete

**⏸️ Pending:**

**Time to complete GitHub setup:** 5 minutes  
**Value:** Remote backup + easy sharing  
**Risk without it:** Only on local machine  

**Create the GitHub repo and give me the URL?** 🎯
