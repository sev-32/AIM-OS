## 🎯 What is AIM-OS?

**The Problem:** Current AI systems are brilliant idiots—they hallucinate, forget context, can't explain their reasoning, and break when you scale them.

**Our Solution:** Five architectural invariants that transform AI from "chatbot" to "cognitive operating system":

| Invariant | What It Solves | How |
|-----------|----------------|-----|
| **CMC** - Context Memory Core | "It forgot everything we discussed" | Structured, queryable, bitemporal memory |
| **HHNI** - Neural Index | "Lost in the middle" problem | Hierarchical retrieval with physics-guided scoring |
| **APOE** - Orchestration Engine | "It just improvised and failed" | Compiled plans with budgets and gates |
| **VIF** - Intelligence Framework | "I can't trust its answers" | Every output has traceable provenance |
| **SEG** - Evidence Graph | "It contradicted itself" | Time-sliced knowledge graph with conflict detection |
| **SDF-CVF** - Evolution Framework | "Docs are out of sync with code" | Code/docs/tests evolve atomically or not at all |

**Result:** An AI system that **remembers everything, orchestrates complex work, proves its reasoning, evolves coherently, and maintains auditable evidence**—forever.

## ⚡ Why This Matters

### For Developers
```python
# Instead of this nightmare:
response = llm.query("What did we discuss about authentication?")
# "I don't have access to previous conversations..."

# You get this:
atom_id = cmc.query(tags=["authentication", "session-2025-10-21"])
context = cmc.get_full_lineage(atom_id)  # Complete history with sources
response = llm.query(prompt, context=context, witness=True)
# Verified answer with full provenance chain
```

### For AI Systems
- **No more hallucinations** → Every claim has a witness chain
- **No more context loss** → HHNI retrieves exactly what you need
- **No more mystery failures** → Full replay capability with VIF envelopes
- **No more drift** → SDF-CVF keeps everything aligned

### For Teams
- **Debug before it happens** → Catch errors at idea level, not code level
- **Perfect collaboration** → Multiple AIs work together without context loss
- **Full auditability** → Every decision is traceable to source
- **Fearless experimentation** → Instant rollback with bitemporal snapshots

    G -.->|governs| D
    G -.->|governs| E
    G -.->|governs| F
```

### 1. **CMC** (Context Memory Core)
**What:** Structured, bitemporal memory store  
**Why:** "Forget" is not an option for AGI  
**How:**
- Atoms: typed, tagged, embedded memory units
- Snapshots: content-addressed, immutable bundles
- Transaction time (TT) + Valid time (VT) for time travel
- Query by tag, semantic similarity, or graph traversal

**Status:** ✅ 80% complete

### 2. **HHNI** (Hierarchical Hypergraph Neural Index)
**What:** Fractal index with physics-guided retrieval  
**Why:** Solves "lost in the middle" and context overload  
**How:**
- 6-level hierarchy: system → section → paragraph → sentence → word → subword
- Dependency hashing for change impact
- DVNS physics (gravity/elastic/repulse/damping) for scoring
- Two-stage retrieval: semantic → physics refinement

**Status:** 🔥 95% complete (Week 3 nearly done)

**Innovation:** Nobody else has physics-guided retrieval!

### 3. **APOE** (AI-Powered Orchestration Engine)
**What:** Compiles reasoning into executable plans  
**Why:** Replace improvisation with verification  
**How:**
- Plans are DAGs with roles, budgets, gates
- ACL (AIMOS Chain Language) execution
- κ-gating for confidence-based routing
- Full witness trace for replay

**Status:** ✅ 50% complete

### 4. **VIF** (Verifiable Intelligence Framework)
**What:** Provenance envelope for every output  
**Why:** Claims without lineage are hallucinations  
**How:**
- VIF envelope: model, prompt, tools, snapshot, uncertainty
- Deterministic replay capability
- Uncertainty quantification (entropy, ECE, confidence bands)
- Export packs for audit

**Status:** 🔄 30% complete

### 5. **SEG** (Shared Evidence Graph)
**What:** Time-sliced, typed knowledge graph  
**Why:** Evidence is relationships, not documents  
**How:**
- Nodes: claims, sources, derivations
- Edges: supports, contradicts, derives, witnesses
- Bitemporal queries (AsOf, Between)
- Conflict detection and resolution

**Status:** 🔄 30% complete

### 6. **SDF-CVF** (Atomic Evolution Framework)
**What:** Ensures code/docs/tests/traces evolve together  
**Why:** Drift is the enemy of trust  
**How:**
- Parity score P across quartet
- Quarantine loop for P < threshold
- Auto-remediation suggestions
- Gated promotion to mainline

**Status:** 🔄 50% complete
