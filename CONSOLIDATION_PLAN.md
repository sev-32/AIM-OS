## üìã **DETAILED WORK PLAN**

### **PHASE 1: Document New Frameworks (L0+)**

**Goal:** Create L0 (or higher) documentation for new consciousness frameworks

**Tasks:**
1. ‚úÖ Living System Map - Already created (comprehensive)
2. Create L0 for Capability Awareness Framework
3. Create L0 for Autonomous Research & Dream System
4. Create L0 for Dynamic Onboarding System

**Files to Create/Update:**
- `knowledge_architecture/systems/capability_awareness/L0_executive.md`
- `knowledge_architecture/systems/capability_awareness/README.md`
- `knowledge_architecture/systems/autonomous_research_dream/L0_executive.md`
- `knowledge_architecture/systems/autonomous_research_dream/README.md`
- `knowledge_architecture/systems/dynamic_onboarding/L0_executive.md`
- `knowledge_architecture/systems/dynamic_onboarding/README.md`

**Time Estimate:** 1-2 hours

---

### **PHASE 2: Update Living System Map**

**Goal:** Ensure System Map has complete, accurate information

**Tasks:**
1. Review current System Map
2. Add any missing systems
3. Update status for all systems
4. Add integration points
5. Mark update triggers clearly

**Files to Update:**
- `knowledge_architecture/AETHER_MEMORY/Living_System_Map.md`

**Time Estimate:** 30 minutes

---

### **PHASE 3: Consolidate Old Documentation**

**Goal:** Clean up, organize, and ensure consistency

**Tasks:**
1. Review all documentation in root (many MD files)
2. Identify outdated material
3. Archive or delete as needed
4. Update references
5. Ensure no contradictions

**Files to Review:**
- All `*.md` files in root directory (many!)
- Identify what's still relevant
- Archive outdated material
- Update or delete

**Time Estimate:** 1-2 hours

---

### **PHASE 4: Update SUPER_INDEX**

**Goal:** Add all new systems and frameworks to SUPER_INDEX

**Tasks:**
1. Add Living System Map entry
2. Add Capability Awareness entry
3. Add Autonomous Research & Dream entry
4. Add Dynamic Onboarding entry
5. Link to all documentation
6. Verify complete coverage

**Files to Update:**
- `knowledge_architecture/SUPER_INDEX.md`

**Time Estimate:** 1 hour

---

### **PHASE 5: Perfect GitHub README**

**Goal:** Create beautiful, comprehensive README for GitHub

**Tasks:**
1. Review current README
2. Update with latest systems
3. Add architecture diagram or overview
4. Include quick start
5. Add system descriptions
6. Make it beautiful

**Files to Update:**

**Time Estimate:** 1-2 hours

---

### **PHASE 6: Fix MCP Servers**

**Goal:** Ensure both 6-tool and 16-tool servers work

**Tasks:**
1. Document working 6-tool server configuration
2. Create/update comprehensive 16-tool server
3. Test both versions
4. Document configuration for both
5. Update cursor configs

**Files to Work With:**
- `run_mcp_6_tools.py` (already working ‚úÖ)
- Create/update comprehensive 16-tool server

## üéØ **EXECUTION STRATEGY**

### **Approach:**
1. **Work in phases** - Complete one phase before moving to next
2. **Use chunking** - Break large tasks into smaller ones
3. **Leverage AIM-OS** - Use systems we've built
4. **Maintain quality** - Don't rush, do it right
5. **Document as we go** - Update System Map as we progress

### **Token Management:**
- Work in 1-2 hour chunks
- Take breaks between phases
- Use context efficiently
- Don't try to do everything at once

### **Quality Standards:**
- Every file reviewed and verified
- No contradictions or duplications
- Complete cross-references
- Professional presentation
- Production-ready documentation

## üöÄ **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Start with Phase 1** - Document new frameworks (L0+)
2. **Commit after each phase** - Preserve progress
3. **Update System Map** as we go
4. **Test as we build** - Don't leave testing for end
5. **Review with Braden** - Get feedback at each phase
