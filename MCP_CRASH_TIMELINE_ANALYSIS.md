# MCP Crash Timeline Analysis - What Really Happened

**Issue:** MCP server with 6+ tools crashed and we lost track of what was working  
**Root Cause:** We built on top of broken Python servers without testing the foundation  
**Solution:** Go back to the original working Node.js server and rebuild incrementally

## üîç **THE CRASH TIMELINE**

### **Phase 1: Original Working Server (Green Dot)**
**Status:** ‚úÖ Working with green dot  
**Server:** Node.js test server (`server.mjs`)  
**Tools:** 2 tools (echo, ping)  
**Configuration:** Simple, no API keys, no complex dependencies  

### **Phase 2: First Python Attempt (Broken from Start)**
**Status:** ‚ùå Broken from the start  
**Server:** `run_mcp_simple.py`  
**Tools:** 3 tools (store_memory, retrieve_memory, get_memory_stats)  
**Issue:** Logging to stdout corrupts MCP protocol  
**Result:** Red dot, tools never work  

### **Phase 3: Second Python Attempt (Still Broken)**
**Status:** ‚ùå Still broken  
**Server:** `run_mcp_aimos_simple.py`  
**Tools:** 2 tools (store_memory, get_memory_stats)  
**Issue:** Same stdout logging problem  
**Result:** Red dot, tools never work  

### **Phase 4: Third Python Attempt (Still Broken)**
**Status:** ‚ùå Still broken  
**Server:** `run_mcp_stdio_clean.py`  
**Tools:** 3 tools (ask_agent, retrieve_memory, get_agent_stats)  
**Issue:** Same stdout logging problem  
**Result:** Red dot, tools never work  

### **Phase 5: Fourth Python Attempt (Still Broken)**
**Status:** ‚ùå Still broken  
**Server:** `run_mcp_cross_model.py`  
**Tools:** 16 tools (6 existing + 10 cross-model)  
**Issue:** Same stdout logging problem  
**Result:** Red dot, tools never work  

### **Phase 6: Fifth Python Attempt (Still Broken)**
**Status:** ‚ùå Still broken  
**Server:** `run_mcp_aimos.py`  
**Tools:** 3 tools (store_memory, retrieve_memory, get_memory_stats)  
**Issue:** Same stdout logging problem  
**Result:** Red dot, tools never work

## üö® **THE REAL PROBLEM**

### **Python Servers Are Fundamentally Broken:**
- **Logging to stdout** - Corrupts MCP protocol
- **Wrong response format** - Not following MCP protocol
- **Import errors** - AIM-OS modules not working in MCP context
- **Environment issues** - Different Python environment in Cursor

### **Node.js Server Works Because:**
- **Simple dependencies** - Only MCP SDK
- **Proper protocol** - Follows MCP spec correctly
- **No complex imports** - No AIM-OS modules
- **Clean stdout** - No logging interference

---

## üìä **WHAT WE HAD BEFORE THE CRASH**

### **The Confusion:**
**You're absolutely right! We DID have more than 2 tools working!**

### **What We Actually Had:**
1. **Node.js test server** - 2 tools (echo, ping) - ‚úÖ Working with green dot
2. **Python servers** - 3-16 tools - ‚ùå Never worked (red dot from the start)

### **The Misunderstanding:**
**We thought the Python servers were working because:**
- They passed standalone tests
- They listed tools correctly in tests
- We assumed they were improvements over the Node.js server

**But they NEVER worked in Cursor because:**
- They had stdout logging issues
- They didn't follow MCP protocol correctly
- They had environment/dependency issues

---

## üéØ **THE SOLUTION**

### **Go Back to What Actually Works:**
**Use the original Node.js test server that was working with green dot!**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aimos-memory": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:/Users/bombe/OneDrive/Desktop/AIM-OS/mcp-aether/server.mjs"]
    }
  }
}
```

### **Why This Works:**
- ‚úÖ **Known working** - We know it worked before
- ‚úÖ **Simple** - No complex dependencies
- ‚úÖ **Proper protocol** - Follows MCP spec
- ‚úÖ **Green dot guaranteed** - Should work immediately

---

## üöÄ **NEXT STEPS**

### **Step 1: Switch to Working Server**
```bash
# Copy the working configuration
Copy-Item cursor_mcp_config_working.json "C:\Users\bombe\.cursor\mcp.json" -Force
```

### **Step 2: Restart Cursor**
1. **Close Cursor completely**
2. **Wait 5 seconds**
3. **Restart Cursor**
4. **Check MCP panel** - should show green dot

### **Expected Result:**
- **Green dot** next to "aimos-memory"
- **2 tools available** - echo, ping
- **Working MCP integration**

---

## üí° **FUTURE PLANS**

### **Short Term:**
1. **Get green dot working** with Node.js server
2. **Verify tools work** in Cursor
3. **Document the working configuration**

### **Medium Term:**
1. **Fix Python servers** - Debug the logging and protocol issues
2. **Test incrementally** - Fix one issue at a time
3. **Add features gradually** - Don't add complexity until basics work

### **Long Term:**
1. **Migrate to Python** - When it's working reliably
2. **Add real AIM-OS features** - Memory, AI, etc.
3. **Full integration** - Complete MCP server with all features

---

## üéØ **CONCLUSION**

**We've been building on top of a broken foundation!**

**The solution is simple: Go back to what works!**

**Use the original Node.js test server that was working with green dot.**

**Once we have green dot working, we can fix the Python servers incrementally.**
