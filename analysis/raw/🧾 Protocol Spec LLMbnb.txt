 OUTCOME
🌀
: users rent out compute clusters (like render farms for AI)
LLM Cluster Rentals
: reputation-based AI trust layers
Federated trust graph
DAO governance of the platform
 EXTENSION VISION
🌐
A distributed DAO oversees dispute resolution and model removals
Models are flagged if they generate toxic, harmful, or fake identity outputs
Users can’t access host machines directly
Hosts cannot access user prompts or data

One-click launcher tool wraps local model into API service + wallet-auth layer
:
Minimal Setup GUI
Hosts can offload overflow to cloud if local system is overwhelmed
:
Auto Scaling Hooks
Tunnel exposure via tools like ngrok or Tailscale
Use containers or VMs (e.g., Docker) to host LLM instances safely

API access is containerized — no user can access host system files or processes.
:
Usage Isolation
Models are sandboxed and scanned before listing (e.g., no exfiltration, hallucination flags).
:
Model Audit System
e.g., “0x8f1… hosts a fine-tuned legal GPT model.”
Users authenticate via blockchain wallets or decentralized identity (DID) systems.
