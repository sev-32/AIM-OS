GODN models nodes as masses in a dynamic system, where interactions minimize total energy to achieve emergent optimization (e.g., clustering for TSP or protein folding). Derivations start from fundamental physics laws.
#### 1. Theoretical Foundations: Gravitational and Elastic Components
I'll structure this by major components, explaining assumptions, steps, and interpretations. For closed-ended mathematical elements (e.g., force from potential), I'll provide the final expression followed by the derivation process. Visual aids are included where they enhance understanding of potentials and forces, as these concepts benefit from diagrams in physics simulations.
The Graviton Organic Dynamics Network (GODN), as outlined in the provided document (dated October 12, 2025), is a framework that integrates gravitational dynamics, elastic perimeters, and emergent behavior for optimization. While the document provides a high-level structure, the mathematical foundations and derivations are implied through physics-inspired principles, drawing from classical mechanics (e.g., Newton's law of gravitation, Hooke's law for elasticity) adapted to computational self-organization. Below, I derive the key equations step-by-step, based on the document's sections (e.g., 2.4 Total Energy Equation, 3.2 Total Force Equation, 3.3 Energy-Based Dynamics, and 3.1 Dynamic Adjustments). These derivations use symbolic mathematics to ensure transparency, showing how to arrive at each solution.
