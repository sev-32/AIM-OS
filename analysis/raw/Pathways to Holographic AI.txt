The path ahead is undeniably long and fraught with technical and theoretical hurdles. However, the convergence of ideas from optics, computer science, neuroscience, and mathematics, coupled with the relentless drive to harness the power of computation on accessible hardware, makes the future of holographic cognition an exceptionally exciting and potentially revolutionary frontier in the ongoing quest to create truly intelligent machines.
 The increasing sophistication of XR technologies could provide richer means for humans to input data into, and receive insights from, holographic AIs, creating a feedback loop that drives innovation in both AI and interface design. This could fundamentally alter human-machine collaboration, leading to more symbiotic relationships where humans and AIs co-create and problem-solve within shared, intuitively understood representational spaces.

The development of holographic AI is also likely to co-evolve with human-computer interfaces. As AI's internal representations become more "holographic," our methods of interacting with these systems may also need to become more spatially intuitive, moving beyond current screen-and-keyboard paradigms towards volumetric, augmented, or virtual reality interfaces.

 As conventional scaling laws for dominant AI models encounter constraints related to data, energy consumption, and computational cost, alternative models become increasingly attractive. If holographic-inspired computation proves to be fundamentally more efficient, expressive, or scalable for certain classes of complex problems—especially those involving intricate relational structures, spatio-temporal dynamics, or holistic scene understanding—it could unlock capabilities that are currently beyond our reach.

Furthermore, the quest for radically different computational paradigms like holographic-inspired intelligence, often driven by the inherent limitations of current approaches and drawing inspiration from the fundamental laws of physics, could represent an unexpected yet potent route towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
symbolic precursor to the symbolic concept of "chair." This suggests a pathway for symbol grounding, a persistent challenge in AI, potentially leading to systems that combine the fluidity of sub-symbolic processing with the explicit reasoning of symbolic AI.
The potential for holographic AI to bridge the gap between sub-symbolic pattern recognition and symbolic reasoning is particularly noteworthy. The inherently sub-symbolic nature of holographic representations (fields, interference patterns) might naturally give rise to higher-level invariances or concepts. For example, a stable, recurring interference pattern representing the "essence" of various chairs could become an internal, sub-
1
 This could be akin to a more intuitive, gestalt form of perception, where the whole of a scene or concept is grasped through the overall "shape" and dynamics of its internal representational field. Such an understanding might prove more robust and less brittle than current approaches, particularly in the face of novel situations or adversarial perturbations that exploit the weaknesses of symbolic systems.
1
 This exploration prompts a redefinition of what "understanding" might mean for an AI. A holographic AI might comprehend its environment less through explicit symbolic labeling and logical deduction, and more through the recognition, manipulation, and evolution of complex, high-dimensional interference patterns.
1
The pursuit of holographic cognition also carries philosophical implications. If an AI begins to "think" in a manner that is fundamentally different from current computational architectures—one based on interference, distributed representation, and emergent properties of wave interactions—it could reshape our understanding of intelligence itself.
1
 Furthermore, new forms of machine creativity and problem-solving might emerge if an AI can manipulate and reason with information encoded in these rich, wave-like patterns.
1
 It could foster AIs with a deeper, more integrated understanding of complex spatial, temporal, and abstract domains, moving beyond current models that often excel at specific tasks but lack broad contextual awareness or robust generalization.

The long-term vision of an AI endowed with true holographic internal thought structures is compelling. Such a system could enable more intuitive and nuanced human-AI interaction, as its internal "language" might more closely align with holistic or associative human cognitive processes.

Key findings indicate that while the journey is complex, the foundational elements necessary for investigating and developing such systems are steadily emerging from diverse scientific and engineering disciplines. Promising avenues include the continued development of efficient neural approximations for wave physics, the integration of non-Euclidean geometries to create more natural internal representational spaces for relational and distributed information, the leveraging of ubiquitous consumer sensors for rich and continuous sensory input, and the collaborative advancement spurred by open-source projects and experimental platforms.

The significant challenges of integrating disparate techniques and bridging theoretical gaps in "holographic cognition" point towards a paramount need for research in "holographic cognitive architecture." Progress will likely depend less on isolated breakthroughs in individual component technologies (e.g., optics, machine learning) and more on developing a cohesive framework that defines how information flows, transforms, and gives rise to reasoning within such a complex, wave-based system. The "chicken and egg" problem, where the nature of the holographic representation influences required computations and vice-versa, is a central aspect of this architectural challenge.

Potential Architectural Considerations:
Addressing these challenges might involve exploring novel AI architectures and focusing research in several key areas:
Potential Architectural Considerations and Promising Research Trajectories
1
 A key aspiration of a self-organizing, holographically-inspired system is the potential for emergent behaviors and understanding that are not explicitly programmed. This powerful prospect also carries the risk of unpredictability and opacity. If the internal workings become too complex and distributed to be easily interpretable, challenges related to debugging, verification, and ensuring alignment with human values and intentions could arise.
Unpredictability and Opacity:
1
 As the complexity of perceived environments and the desired sophistication of internal representations increase, how these wave-inspired approaches scale without exceeding the computational and memory limitations of consumer hardware is a critical question.
Scalability:
1
 While datasets exist for specific sub-tasks (e.g., MIT-CGH-4K for CGH generation), training an end-to-end system capable of recursive spatial perception and genuinely holographic internal thought would likely require new, comprehensive datasets capturing dynamic interactions in complex environments. Alternatively, highly effective unsupervised or self-supervised learning methods will be essential.
Data Scarcity for Holistic Training:
1
 The concept of "holographic thought structuring" is still largely metaphorical and nascent. A robust theoretical framework defining how an AI would "think" holographically—performing reasoning, planning, learning, and decision-making—is currently lacking.
Theoretical Gaps in "Holographic Cognition":
1
 Weaving together neural networks, wave physics simulations (or their approximations), non-Euclidean geometric concepts, and real-time multi-sensor fusion into a coherent, functioning system is a monumental engineering and research undertaking.

 Concurrently, non-Euclidean geometries provide a more "natural language" for the relational aspects of holographic thought, potentially offering a more fundamental mathematical underpinning than Euclidean space.

 Waves inherently offer higher information density for representation due to characteristics like phase and frequency, beyond simple amplitude.
Information Density and Natural Representational Frameworks:

 The relationship between the desired holographic representation and the computational methods needed to support it is intricate, resembling a "chicken and egg" scenario where advancements in computational methods might enable richer holographic representations, which in turn demand new computational approaches, fostering co-development.

 The constraint of consumer hardware is a powerful driver for algorithmic innovation. Projects like Tensor Holography (designed for laptops) and VistaFlow (performing on integrated graphics) exemplify this.
Efficient Algorithms & Hardware Co-evolution:

 A crucial enabler is the capability of neural networks to approximate or efficiently compute complex physical processes such as light propagation and diffraction. This "learned physics" allows systems to bypass computationally expensive brute-force simulations, which is essential for achieving real-time performance on consumer hardware.
"Learned Physics":

 AI-driven calibration techniques and inherently calibration-lite methods like neural network-enhanced SIDH are vital for an AI that needs to autonomously adapt to its sensory apparatus and maintain perceptual accuracy.
Adaptability and Robustness:

The observed spectrum of development, from pure software simulations like the Unified Holographic Neural Network to systems incorporating real optical components and sensors, and finally to complete display systems, suggests a valuable "simulation-to-reality" pipeline. Algorithms and AI models can be initially developed and rigorously tested within simulated optical environments running on standard consumer GPUs. As these simulated components mature and prove their efficacy, they can gradually inform the design of, or be transitioned to, specialized hardware co-processors if and when efficient and cost-effective hardware becomes available. This approach de-risks the development process, allowing for rapid iteration on the "software" aspects of holographic thought and representation, even if the ideal consumer-grade "hardware" for direct optical processing is still some years away. It implies that an AI's internal holographic model might initially be entirely simulated, with the 
The proliferation of open-source projects is particularly vital in a highly interdisciplinary field like holographic AI, which merges optics, artificial intelligence, computer graphics, and physics. Open access to code and methodologies allows experts from one domain to more readily engage with and build upon tools and concepts from others, fostering essential cross-pollination of ideas and helping to overcome the complex integration challenges inherent in this research area. This collaborative ecosystem, fueled by open sharing, is likely to accelerate the pace of discovery and could lead to de facto standards for certain approaches, thereby guiding future research and development efforts.

Section VI: Current Progress and Enabling Technologies: Demonstrating Feasibility
 A truly self-organizing AI should possess the ability to understand, adapt to, and potentially even learn the characteristics of its own sensory apparatus. This continuous self-calibration and adaptation can be viewed as a rudimentary form of embodied self-awareness, where the AI develops an internal model not only of the external world but also of its own perceptual capabilities and limitations. If an AI can learn and adapt to its own physical (or simulated physical) embodiment, it might develop a more grounded understanding of its operational context, potentially leading to more reliable and predictable behavior when interacting with the physical world. This is crucial for maintaining perceptual accuracy in changing conditions or as sensors degrade over time.
1
The trend towards AI-driven calibration and the development of calibration-lite systems like neural network-enhanced SIDH are critical for enabling robust AI operation on the diverse and often imperfect hardware found in consumer electronics.
 Each device (smartphones, wearables, IoT gadgets), while individually possessing limited sensing capabilities and a restricted viewpoint, could contribute its partial sensory input to the collective. An AI with a holographic internal model could then fuse these distributed "wavefronts" of information, allowing them to interfere and coalesce into a more complete, robust, and multi-perspective internal representation of space. This creates a "social network of sensors" where the collective perception is inherently more resilient to individual sensor failures or occlusions, aligning with the fault-tolerant nature of holographic principles. Such a system could lead to an emergent "situational awareness" at a broader environmental or community level, though this also introduces significant considerations regarding privacy, security, and data governance if personal devices are continuously contributing to a collective AI.

The convergence of the Internet of Agents (IoA) concept with the ubiquity of sensor-equipped consumer devices points towards a future where a holographically-inspired AI might perceive its environment not merely through a single set of sensors, but through a dynamic 
scanning of the object or complex calibration procedures involving multiple optical components or precise alignments.
A particularly promising approach for achieving robust 3D perception with minimal calibration overhead is self-interference digital holography (SIDH), especially when augmented by deep learning.1 Research has demonstrated a deep learning approach using a 3D neural network to overcome the limitations typically associated with SIDH, particularly its inferior axial imaging performance. The key achievement is "3D non-scanning volumetric fluorescence microscopy... using [a] 2D self-interference hologram as input, without any mechanical and opto-electronic scanning and complicated system calibration".1 In SIDH, a wavefront from the object interferes with a part of itself (e.g., an undiffracted portion or a reference wave derived from the source illumination), encoding 3D information into the resulting 2D interference pattern. The neural network then learns to reconstruct the 3D volume directly from this self-interference pattern.1 This process effectively allows the network to "decode" the depth information without requiring explicit

The principle of AI-driven automation of calibration, analogous to how machine learning is used in quantum computing to automate qubit calibration and optimize gate operations, is broadly applicable to complex sensor systems on consumer devices, where manual calibration is often impractical.

 This suggests that AI can

Neural holography research has introduced "learned camera-calibrated propagation models" and "gradient-based camera-calibration techniques paired with new optical system designs" to achieve high image quality and enable compact displays.
The process by which an AI understands the relationship between its sensor readings and the physical world, and potentially its own internal representational space (or "phase-space"), is critical. In XR systems, "precise calibration and registration are paramount, encompassing spatial alignment, accurate color reproduction, distortion correction, and dynamic registration to seamlessly merge the virtual and real".1 While this primarily refers to display calibration in XR, the underlying principle of accurately calibrating sensors to the physical world and to each other is fundamental for any AI that relies on those sensors for spatial understanding and action.
Hardware Calibration for Internal Phase-Space:
1
For an AI to reliably interpret sensory data from diverse consumer hardware, which can vary in quality and be subject to environmental influences, robust self-mapping and calibration mechanisms are essential.
The Critical Role of Self-Mapping and Adaptive Calibration
The core idea of a live, recursive framework is that the AI is not merely constructing a one-time map or model of its surroundings. Instead, it is engaged in a continuous process of updating its internal spatial model based on the constant influx of new sensory information from these consumer devices.1 Each new observation can be conceptualized as "interfering" with the AI's existing internal "hologram," thereby refining, correcting, and evolving its understanding of the world.1 This dynamic updating is crucial for any embodied AI that needs to navigate, interact with, and adapt to complex, real-world environments that are rarely static.
Live, Recursive Framework:
1
 Within an IoA, agents can self-organize, collaborate, and share sensory information. This is highly pertinent to creating a distributed, recursive perception system that leverages multiple IoT devices or smartphones. Key features of IoA, such as "evolving agent capability" based on context and "real-time workflow reconfiguration," are essential for dynamic spatial understanding in changing environments.

 further underscores this. It is argued that AI's next significant advancement will be powered by hardware that allows it to move into physical spaces. "AI needs spatial intelligence – an awareness of physical space – to reach its potential," and devices like AR glasses, AI-powered headsets, and smart rings or watches are enabling AI to interpret gestures, movements, and environmental context more naturally.

The domain of 
The Extended Reality (XR) ecosystem exemplifies this trend, with devices from companies like Meta, HTC, and Apple incorporating outward-facing RGB cameras, depth sensors (such as structured light, Time-of-Flight (ToF), or LiDAR), and inward-facing cameras for tracking hand positions and gestures.1 These sensor suites are becoming standard in consumer-facing XR hardware. The notion of "spatial intelligence," where XR aims to establish a "brand-new space in digits with realistic experience," is highly relevant.1 To manage computational demands on these often resource-constrained devices, strategies like "split devices" that distribute processing tasks to external processors or the cloud are being employed.1
Consumer devices are increasingly equipped with a variety of sensors that can provide the raw data for such perception.
Ubiquitous Sensors as Data Sources:
 This is a dynamic process, far removed from static map-building.
1
The concept of recursive spatial perception involves an AI continuously updating its internal model of the environment and its own state within that environment based on an ongoing stream of sensory input.
Achieving Recursive Spatial Perception with Consumer Devices
1
For a holographically-inspired intelligence to be truly effective, especially one operating on consumer hardware, it must be capable of perceiving and interacting with the physical world. This necessitates robust mechanisms for recursive spatial perception using ubiquitous sensors, alongside sophisticated self-mapping and calibration capabilities to ensure reliable operation in diverse and uncontrolled environments.
Section V: Embodiment and Real-World Interaction on Consumer Platforms
, suggests a path towards AI systems with invariant perception. If an AI learns to recognize objects or situations based on their fundamental topological structure rather than precise metric details, it could become significantly more robust to noisy sensor data, adversarial attacks that rely on minor perturbations, or variations in viewpoint and illumination. An AI grounded in such topological understanding might develop a more abstract and conceptual grasp of its environment. For instance, the concept of "containment" could be understood as a general principle applicable across diverse scenarios (a cup holding water, a house containing rooms, a category containing instances) if all are represented by similar topological relationships in its internal model. This could be a pathway to more human-like abstract reasoning.

Furthermore, the emphasis on topological approaches, which focus on properties preserved under deformation like connectedness and offer robustness as seen in TMNNs 
such a space might inherently learn conceptual hierarchies more efficiently than one attempting to fit them into a Euclidean framework. This could lead to AI systems that are better at generalization and transferring learned knowledge across domains that share similar underlying relational structures. This shift could fundamentally alter AI reasoning systems, moving from discrete symbol manipulation towards processes that emerge from navigating and transforming representations within these non-Euclidean "thought manifolds," potentially leading to AI that "reasons" more intuitively.
 If the internal "space" where an AI models relationships is not constrained to be flat or grid-like, but can be curved or topologically complex, its learning processes might become more adept at capturing abstract relationships and analogies. For example, hyperbolic spaces excel at representing tree-like structures; an AI utilizing 
1
The adoption of non-Euclidean geometries can be seen as providing a more "natural grammar" for an AI to represent the inherently relational information processed in holographic thought.
 This democratization of the input side means that the rich spatial data required for such a system could potentially be sourced from the vast majority of existing consumer devices.
1
 These 2D-to-3D understanding systems serve as vital stepping stones. The ability to derive rich 3D understanding from standard 2D sensors through techniques like MDE, and then to feed this information into systems like SpatialBot, is paramount for making advanced spatial AI capabilities accessible on ubiquitous consumer devices.

The overarching goal is to progress towards an AI that

While systems like 
 This work is significant as it explicitly targets the teaching of spatial reasoning to VLMs using depth data obtainable from consumer-grade sensors.
1
 This directly aligns with the goal of using standard 2D sensors. SpatialBot is trained to understand spatial concepts at multiple levels: low-level (raw depth values, point coordinates), mid-level (proximity relationships, depth characteristics of objects), and high-level (grounding objects, counting, abstract spatial relationships).
1
 To facilitate this, researchers have curated datasets like SpatialQA (for RGB-D question answering) and SpatialBench (for evaluating spatial understanding). A key strategy is the use of RGB-D cameras, which are becoming increasingly common and affordable, or the application of Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) techniques to convert standard RGB image datasets into RGB-D datasets.

 This project aims to enhance the spatial understanding of Vision Language Models (VLMs) by providing them with both RGB and depth image inputs.

A critical aspect of developing AI with advanced spatial awareness on consumer hardware is the ability to derive rich 3D understanding from readily available 2D sensors, such as webcams and smartphone cameras.
Implicit Spatial Understanding from Ubiquitous 2D Sensors
1
 This focus on invariant properties could form the basis for a more abstract and robust form of spatial understanding, one that is less susceptible to minor variations in input data (e.g., slight changes in viewpoint or object position). This aligns with the holographic concept of capturing the "essence" or global structure of a scene rather than merely a collection of discrete points. The demonstrated "damage tolerance" of TMNNs is a direct illustration of the robustness that topological principles can confer.
1
Topological approaches emphasize properties that are preserved under continuous deformation, such as connectedness or containment.
 This serves as a hardware example of a non-coordinate-based computational structure whose behavior is governed by wave physics.
1
Photonic neural networks that use components like metasurfaces inherently perform computation via diffraction and interference of light waves. Multilayer diffractive architectures, where stacked 2D metasurfaces act as neuron layers, create a physical neural topology where computation is a direct result of wave interaction.
1
 SOMs are unsupervised learning models that map high-dimensional input data onto a lower-dimensional topological space, preserving the similarity relationships present in the input data. While the "quantum-assisted" aspect may currently exceed typical consumer hardware capabilities, the foundational use of SOMs—which are inherently about learning and representing topological relationships in data—is pertinent.
1
 MicroCloud Hologram Inc. reports the development of a Q-SOM, which integrates classical Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOM) neural networks with quantum computing capabilities.
Quantum-Assisted Self-Organizing Feature Maps (Q-SOMs):
 While this specific example is mechanical, the core principle of harnessing topological properties for robust and efficient computation is highly relevant.
1
 These networks utilize pseudospin states and leverage the robustness conferred by the QSHE, making them inherently damage-tolerant for tasks like binary classification. The "topological protection" ensures that localized damage or perturbations have minimal impact on the overall function, as waves in the inference process are guided along topologically protected pathways and barely scatter into the bulk material.
1
 Research into TMNNs, inspired by phenomena like the quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) in topological metamaterials, demonstrates one such avenue.
Topological Mechanical Neural Networks (TMNNs):
Beyond abstract geometries, some neural network architectures draw inspiration from physical systems exhibiting interesting topological properties or wave-like behaviors.
Topological Structures and Their Potential for Robust Representation
1
 The "shape" or manifold of the AI's internal "phase space," where information wavefronts interact, might be more accurately described by non-Euclidean metrics, as holographic principles themselves are deeply relational.
1
For an AI aiming to develop a holographic or wave-inspired internal model, which inherently deals with relationships, interference phenomena, and distributed information, non-Euclidean geometries could offer a more natural and powerful mathematical framework than rigid XYZ coordinates.
1
 Furthermore, the concept of task-aware adaptability—where embeddings dynamically reconfigure to match the geometry of downstream applications—is proposed to enhance efficiency and expressivity.
1
Strategies for integrating non-Euclidean geometries into foundation models include fine-tuning existing models, training new models from scratch using geometric principles, and developing hybrid approaches that combine Euclidean and non-Euclidean components.
1
 Graphs, cellular complexes, and hypergraphs, which relax the assumption of a regular grid and allow for the representation of more complex relationships and connectivity patterns between data points. These structures emphasize properties like connectedness and adjacency.
Topological Structures:
1
 Spheres, hyperbolic spaces, and tori, which relax the assumption of flatness inherent in Euclidean space and can exhibit positive or negative curvature. Hyperbolic spaces, for example, are particularly well-suited for representing hierarchical data.
Curved Spaces:
The types of non-Euclidean geometries and alternative data structures being explored include:
 By adopting non-Euclidean geometries, AI models could more efficiently leverage these inherent structural properties of data.
1
 Consequently, moving beyond Euclidean geometry is increasingly viewed not merely as an optional enhancement but as a necessity for the continued advancement and scaling of next-generation foundation models.
1
 Data across various domains, including language, vision, and the natural sciences, often exhibit inherently non-Euclidean structures such as multi-way relationships, hierarchies, symmetries, and non-isotropic scaling. Effectively capturing these intricate structures within the constraints of Euclidean spaces proves challenging.
1
The de facto geometric setting for most machine learning architectures has been Euclidean space. However, a growing body of literature argues that this choice imposes fundamental limitations when dealing with complex, real-world data.
Beyond Euclidean Limitations: The Case for Non-Euclidean Geometries in AI
 This section explores approaches that move beyond Euclidean norms, leveraging non-Euclidean geometries, topological concepts, and implicit spatial understanding derived from common 2D sensors.
1
The ambition to create AI with holographic internal interfaces naturally leads to questioning the suitability of traditional, Euclidean coordinate-based (XYZ) spatial models. If an AI is to "think" in terms of distributed interference patterns and wavefronts, its internal "language" for space might need to be more flexible and relational.
Section IV: Reimagining Spatial Cognition: Non-Euclidean and Implicit Models
 The significant effort involved in curating such datasets will inevitably drive strong incentives for research into unsupervised, self-supervised, and few-shot learning techniques tailored for holographic and lightfield data. Furthermore, the ability to transfer knowledge from existing large-scale 2D and 3D vision datasets (e.g., ImageNet, ShapeNet) by adapting pre-trained models to the specifics of holographic representations will become increasingly important. Successfully navigating this data scarcity could lead to AI systems that are inherently more adept at generalizing from limited or imperfect data—a hallmark of robust intelligence. This might also encourage hybrid approaches where AIs learn the fundamental "physics" of holographic interactions from synthetic data, and then refine their representations using real-world, sparsely labeled, or unlabeled data captured by consumer devices.
1
The reliance of many successful neural methods on large, specialized datasets like MIT-CGH-4K underscores a critical bottleneck in the field.
The repurposing of these neurally learned scene representations (e.g., Gaussian primitives, PlenOctrees) for an AI's internal reasoning and planning processes suggests a powerful mechanism for cognitive development. Instead of an AI laboriously constructing spatial understanding from raw sensory data, it could operate upon these pre-structured, yet learned, primitives that already encapsulate significant geometric and appearance information. This could act as a form of "cognitive scaffolding," dramatically accelerating the AI's ability to develop sophisticated spatial reasoning. If an AI's "thought" processes involve the manipulation and interaction of these learned scene components, its reasoning might become inherently tied to a form of internal visual-spatial simulation. This could foster a more intuitive and grounded understanding of the world compared to purely abstract symbolic manipulation, potentially leading to an AI whose "language of thought" is more geometric or field-based.
 The AI's "holographic thought" could, therefore, be based on the manipulation and interaction of these learned, rich scene representations.

sometimes view-dependent effects. Such learned structures could be repurposed or co-opted to serve as an AI's own internal model of the world, used for reasoning, prediction, or planning, rather than solely for visualization.
 These representations, initially optimized for rendering, inherently capture salient 3D structures, appearances, and

 The effort required to create such specialized datasets can be a significant bottleneck. Consequently, methods that can learn effectively from less data, unlabeled data (as in unsupervised learning), or easily acquired data (such as casual smartphone captures used by NHFs) are highly valuable for broader progress and for AIs that need to learn and adapt in novel environments without extensive pre-existing datasets.
1
The success of many of these neural methods, however, hinges on the availability of large, high-quality datasets. The MIT-CGH-4K dataset was instrumental for Tensor Holography, and the hybrid lightfield dataset was key for the unsupervised super-resolution work.
1
 This capability allows them to bypass computationally expensive brute-force simulations, which is essential for real-time performance on consumer hardware.
1
A common thread across these neural approaches to holography and lightfield synthesis is the concept of "learned physics." Neural networks in these domains are not merely performing pattern matching; they are, in effect, learning to approximate or efficiently compute complex physical processes such as light propagation, diffraction, and volumetric rendering.
The Significance of "Learned Physics" for Consumer Hardware Viability
 While NeRFs themselves can be computationally demanding, they offer a potent method for learning implicit 3D scene models.
1
 and their extensions represent a powerful class of techniques for learning 3D scene representations from 2D images. NeRFs typically use a deep neural network to generate a volumetric "radiance field," which assigns a color and density value to every point in a 3D space, conditioned on a 5D coordinate (3D spatial location + 2D viewing direction).

Significantly, VistaFlow is designed to

Lightfields capture richer spatial information than conventional 2D images by recording the direction of light rays, not just their intensity.

 This technique moves towards free-viewpoint holography from minimal input, a vital capability for dynamic perception.

 This approach develops an "artificial-neural-network-based representation for light wave propagation in free space," where the network learns to predict the continuous complex wavefront.

 This optimization is critical for deployment on resource-constrained embedded systems and consumer devices.

 Subsequent work has also explored quantizing Tensor Holography models from 32-bit floating-point precision to 8-bit integer precision (INT8), achieving a roughly 70% reduction in model size and a fourfold increase in speed, while maintaining comparable hologram quality.

 The availability of open-source code for Tensor Holography further accelerates research in this domain.

 This was facilitated by the creation of the MIT-CGH-4K dataset, a large-scale collection of 4,000 pairs of RGB-D images and their corresponding 3D holograms, which was crucial for training the deep learning model.

 of wavefront computing, such as encoding information in relative signal timing, might see more immediate and efficient adoption in electronic systems. These systems would emulate wave-like behaviors rather than using actual light waves. The success of such energy-efficient electronic emulations could, in turn, create a strong case for developing specialized optical co-processors for consumer devices once the software and algorithmic paradigms demonstrating their benefits are mature.

While optical computing offers direct proof-of-concept for wave-based computation, the significant energy efficiency demonstrated by electronic wavefront computing approaches like NIST's Temporal Computing (achieving one to two orders of magnitude lower energy cost for neural network layers) is particularly compelling for consumer hardware.
The abstraction of principles from physical systems like metasurfaces and RIS for simulated internal layers within an AI presents an intriguing possibility. An AI could develop internal, learnable "meta-behaviors" that actively shape its information wavefronts, akin to a "software-defined metamaterial." This could grant the AI extreme adaptability in its information processing, potentially allowing it to dynamically reconfigure its internal computational pathways based on task demands or learned experience. Such a capability might lead to the emergence of novel computational primitives or information processing strategies not explicitly designed by humans, pushing the boundaries of self-adaptive intelligent systems. The AI's very "architecture" could become a plastic, learned entity.
underlying computational advantages of wave-like processing are significant and may transcend the specific physical medium. If efficient simulation techniques or effective abstractions can be developed, these advantages become accessible for AI models operating on consumer hardware.
 This suggests that the

The convergence of principles from optical computing and innovative electronic computing paradigms is noteworthy. Photonic systems perform computations directly using light waves. Simultaneously, electronic systems are being developed to emulate wave-like behavior or to simulate optical phenomena on conventional GPUs.
 The ability of RIS to "direct signals" and "mitigate interference" could be instrumental in managing complex internal wave interactions necessary for a holographic AI.
1
 This involves precise control over the phase and direction of wavefronts. While the primary application discussed is enhancing security and sensing in wireless communications, the fundamental principle of using programmable surfaces to shape wavefronts is directly applicable to the concept of creating dynamic, reconfigurable internal "holographic" representations or computational elements within an AI.
1
Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) represent another relevant technology. RIS "dynamically manipulates electromagnetic waves" and consists of "programmable meta-surfaces that intelligently control wave reflections and transmissions, thereby optimizing the wireless environment".
1
 If a portion of the wave-based representation is corrupted or lost, the remaining parts can often still reconstruct the original information, albeit potentially with reduced fidelity or resolution. This is analogous to how a fragment of a physical hologram can still reproduce the entire image.
Fault Tolerance:
1
 Similar input patterns could excite similar interference patterns, leading to a natural mechanism for associative recall.
Associative Memory:
 This distributed nature is a hallmark of holographic systems and could lead to several advantageous properties for an AI, including:
1
Wave-based representations offer a natural pathway to non-coordinate-based information structuring. In such systems, a piece of information is not stored at a discrete (x,y,z) memory address but is encoded in the overall pattern of interference distributed across a region or volume.
Pathways to Non-Coordinate-Based Information Structuring
The open-source project, the "Unified Holographic Neural Network," explicitly aims to merge holographic memory, neural networks, and optical computing principles. It employs ray tracing to simulate light propagation, modeling optical elements as "refractive and diffractive surfaces" and using "phase functions" for diffraction gratings. Critically, it utilizes CUDA kernels to "simulate wave propagation effects and interference patterns," representing a direct attempt to implement optical, phase-interference-based computation on standard GPU hardware.1 This aligns closely with the goal of creating holographic internal interfaces on consumer platforms.
Simulated Optical Computations:
Additionally, the work of companies like Wooptix in "semiconductor metrology using wavefront phase imaging" contributes to this domain. Although the context is Intel's Edge AI systems, Wooptix's core technology focuses on the analysis of wavefronts, particularly their phase.1 Mature techniques for wavefront analysis could potentially be adapted for an AI to interpret or generate internal representations based on wavefront characteristics.
Beyond optical phenomena, the concept of wavefront computing is also being explored in electronic systems. NIST's "Temporal Computing" initiative provides a compelling example, where information is encoded not in voltage levels but in the relative arrival times of signal wavefronts—a concept termed "race logic".1 In this paradigm, "a wavefront is a set of transitions in a series of wires," and simple logic gates determine which transition arrives first or last, effectively performing computations based on the propagation speeds of different parts of the wavefront.1 While superconducting implementations are highlighted for data centers, the core race logic principle has been demonstrated to work with "conventional integrated circuits" and can achieve computational efficiency for neural network layers at a "one to two-order-of-magnitude lower energy cost".1 This non-optical approach to wavefront computation offers significant potential for energy-efficient AI on consumer hardware.
Wavefront Computing Principles (Electronic):
 While currently specialized, these technologies prove the principle of computation through wave manipulation. The challenge lies in abstracting or efficiently simulating these principles on conventional consumer electronic hardware.
1
 This is a clear demonstration of computation performed via the controlled interference of light waves. Metasurfaces, which are engineered materials with subwavelength features, further exemplify this principle by relying on "diffraction and interference of light between 'surfaces'" to modulate the phase, amplitude, and polarization of light.
1
More directly, Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) offer a hardware substrate for wave-based computation. These circuits utilize "coherent interferometer meshes, microring-resonator (MRR) weight banks, and wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) schemes to perform dense matrix multiplications and multiply-accumulate operations at the speed of light".
The capacity of machine learning to extract meaningful, compressed representations from wave-based data is demonstrated in fields like Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) interference monitoring. Here, techniques such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are employed to disentangle and compress features from signal spectrograms, which are representations of wave characteristics including interference patterns, signal power, and bandwidth.1 This work highlights the potential for managing the complexity of wavefront data within an AI's internal model.
Refractive and Phase-Interference Based Encoding/Visualization:
Several research avenues are actively investigating the use of wave characteristics for computation and representation.
Exploring Computational Paradigms
1
 This increased information density could lead to more efficient, expressive, and powerful internal states within an AI, forming a richer foundation for "holographic thought".
1
 Information can be densely represented by modulating the phase and amplitude of waves, and their subsequent interference patterns can embody computational results or complex data structures.
1
The central idea is to utilize the inherent characteristics of waves, such as amplitude, frequency, and critically, phase, for encoding and processing information. These characteristics offer multiple degrees of freedom, potentially allowing for significantly more information to be encoded per signal compared to simple binary states.
Leveraging Wavefronts, Interference, and Phase in AI
1
The exploration of holographic internal interfaces for AI necessitates a foundational understanding of how wave phenomena—specifically wavefronts, interference, and phase—can be harnessed for computation and information representation. This section delves into computational paradigms that draw inspiration from these principles, moving beyond traditional binary logic to embrace the richer dynamics of wave-based systems.
Section II: Foundational Principles: Wave-Based Computation and Representation
 This lack of transparency could pose significant challenges for debugging, verification, and ensuring alignment with human intentions, echoing broader concerns in AI safety and explainability. The pursuit of such emergent systems may necessitate the development of new paradigms for AI governance, moving beyond the analysis of discrete algorithms to the understanding and guidance of complex, dynamic intelligent systems.
1
The emphasis on self-organizing intelligence and emergent properties, while promising for adaptability and creativity, also introduces complexities. Emergent behavior, by its nature, can be unpredictable. If an AI's internal "holographic thought" arises from intricate, distributed wave interactions, its reasoning processes might become opaque.
unlock deeper capabilities but require specialized hardware. This creates a tension between the democratization of AI and the pursuit of its ultimate theoretical potential. The document appears to favor the former as a catalyst, suggesting that the constraints of consumer hardware will force innovations in efficiency that could then, perhaps, inform more powerful systems.
The drive to implement advanced AI on consumer hardware could lead to a scenario where practical, "good enough" solutions become widespread, potentially overshadowing research into more fundamental, computationally intensive holographic models that might

 However, it also presents a formidable hurdle: wave-based computations, such as comprehensive diffraction simulations, are notoriously intensive. Therefore, substantial innovation is required to render these principles viable and performant on widely available devices like smartphones or standard laptops.

This focus on consumer hardware could catalyze breakthroughs in algorithmic design with far-reaching implications, potentially democratizing access to advanced AI capabilities.
1
 This constraint is not merely a practical limitation but is framed as a significant driver for innovation. While high-end, specialized hardware might permit brute-force solutions to complex computational problems, such solutions often lack scalability or generalizability to a wider audience. The challenge of implementing sophisticated, wave-inspired computational models on resource-constrained consumer platforms compels researchers to devise algorithms that are not only computationally elegant but also exceptionally efficient.
1
A crucial aspect of the vision presented in "Pathways to Holographically-Inspired Intelligence" is the emphasis on leveraging conventional consumer hardware platforms—such as standard CPUs/GPUs, webcams, smartphones, and IoT devices.
The Consumer Hardware Imperative as a Driver for Innovation
The holographic approach could also lead to inherent system properties such as robustness to incomplete or noisy data. Much like a fragment of a physical hologram retains information about the entire scene (albeit at a lower resolution), an AI with a distributed representation might still function effectively even with partial or corrupted input.1 Additionally, the distributed encoding could facilitate a capacity for rapid, associative recall, where similar input patterns can efficiently retrieve related information.1
Robustness and Associative Recall:
Furthermore, an AI equipped with a holographic internal model could achieve a sophisticated form of recursive spatial perception. This involves the AI continuously updating its understanding of its environment and its own position and orientation within it, with new sensory data dynamically interacting with and modifying its existing internal holographic representation.1 This contrasts sharply with systems that construct a static three-dimensional model and subsequently operate upon it. The recursive aspect implies a dynamic, evolving internal "worldview," crucial for agents operating in complex and changing environments.1
Recursive Spatial Perception:
Holographic principles, particularly the distributed and associative nature of information encoding, may inherently support the development of self-organizing internal models within an AI. If information is not rigidly compartmentalized but rather interconnected through wave-like interactions and interference, the system might exhibit emergent organizational properties. This could allow the AI to adapt its internal structure based on experience without explicit, top-down programming for every contingency, a significant departure from current AI development practices.1
Self-Organizing Intelligence:
A primary envisioned benefit is the capacity for a more holistic and context-aware mode of information processing. By encoding information in distributed patterns, the AI might inherently grasp the interconnectedness of data elements, leading to a more intuitive understanding that mirrors aspects of human cognition.1
Holistic, Context-Aware, Intuitive Processing:
The potential benefits of such a paradigm shift are manifold, extending deeply into the realms of self-organizing intelligence and recursive spatial perception.
Envisioned Benefits: Holistic Processing, Self-Organization, and Recursive Perception
1
 The objective is to achieve a form of "holographic thought structuring," an ambitious but compelling goal for next-generation AI that could lead to a more holistic, context-aware, and perhaps even intuitive mode of information processing.
1
This represents a more profound architectural change than simply adding a "3D module" to an existing AI; it necessitates a re-evaluation of the foundational mechanisms by which an AI perceives, represents, and "thinks" about its world.
1
 In contrast, the vision for holographically-inspired AI imagines a system that processes, stores, and retrieves information through distributed, interference-based patterns. This is analogous to how a three-dimensional scene is encoded across the entirety of a holographic plate, where information is not rigidly compartmentalized but rather interconnected through wave-like interactions and interference.
1
The foundational document, "Pathways to Holographically-Inspired Intelligence: A Review of Computational Techniques for Consumer Hardware Platforms," proposes a fundamental shift in how AI represents and processes information. Prevailing AI architectures predominantly rely on discrete, coordinate-based (e.g., XYZ vectors, tensors, graph structures) internal representations of data and spatial information. While powerful, these representations can sometimes be brittle or computationally prohibitive for achieving nuanced spatial understanding or holistic context awareness.
Defining Holographic AI: A Paradigm Shift from Coordinate-Based Representations
1
The pursuit of artificial intelligence (AI) has long been characterized by efforts to imbue machines with capabilities mirroring, and potentially exceeding, human cognition. A significant, yet largely conceptual, frontier in this endeavor is the development of AIs possessing internal interfaces inspired by holographic principles. This vision entails a departure from prevailing AI architectures that predominantly rely on discrete, coordinate-based internal representations of data and spatial information.

While significant challenges remain in implementing these wave-based computational approaches efficiently on consumer hardware, the innovative solutions being developed—from tensor holography to temporal computing—suggest a promising path forward. As these technologies mature and become more accessible, they could fundamentally transform how AI perceives, processes, and interacts with the world, bringing us closer to truly intuitive artificial intelligence.
The convergence of neural networks with optical computing principles has already yielded impressive results, such as real-time hologram generation on consumer hardware. As these techniques continue to evolve, we may witness the emergence of AI systems with internal "holographic thought structures" that offer unprecedented capabilities in terms of associative recall, fault tolerance, and information density.
The pursuit of holographically-inspired intelligence represents a bold reimagining of AI's fundamental computational paradigms. By moving beyond traditional coordinate-based representations toward distributed, interference-based patterns inspired by holographic principles, researchers aim to create AI systems with more holistic, context-aware information processing capabilities.

Similarly, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) dynamically manipulate electromagnetic waves through programmable meta-surfaces that control wave reflections and transmissions1. Although primarily applied to wireless communications, the fundamental principle of using programmable surfaces to shape wavefronts is directly applicable to creating dynamic, reconfigurable internal "holographic" representations within AI systems1.
Metasurfaces—engineered materials with subwavelength features—exemplify how diffraction and interference can modulate the phase, amplitude, and polarization of light1. While currently specialized, these technologies prove the principle of computation through wave manipulation.

representing a direct attempt to implement optical, phase-interference-based computation on standard GPU hardware1.

The challenge of implementing wave-based computations on resource-constrained devices compels researchers to devise exceptionally efficient algorithms1. This constraint has catalyzed breakthroughs such as MIT's tensor holography approach, which can generate holograms "in the blink of an eye" on a laptop—something previously thought impossible with consumer-grade hardware
A core emphasis of current research is implementing these sophisticated holographic techniques on conventional consumer hardware rather than specialized equipment1. While high-end, specialized hardware might permit brute-force solutions to complex computational problems, focusing on consumer platforms drives innovation toward algorithmic elegance and efficiency.

MIT researchers have developed a groundbreaking method called "Tensor Holography" that employs a convolutional neural network with trainable tensors to approximate light propagation physics1
Neural holography leverages deep learning to overcome traditional challenges in Computer-Generated Holography (CGH), such as high computational costs and image quality limitations1. Neural networks can learn complex mappings from scene data to the phase patterns required for holographic display, dramatically reducing computation time.

The integration of neural networks with holographic principles has led to significant advancements in generating and interpreting holographic data efficiently enough for consumer hardware1. These approaches are crucial for realizing holographic internal 
Neural Approaches to Holography and Lightfield Synthesis
: If portions of the wave-based representation are corrupted or lost, the remaining parts can often still reconstruct the original information, albeit potentially at lower fidelity1. This mirrors how a fragment of a physical hologram can still reproduce an entire image, a robustness highly desirable for AI systems.
Fault Tolerance
: Similar input patterns could excite similar interference patterns, creating a natural mechanism for associative recall1. This mirrors how human memory often works through association rather than exact address matching.
Associative Memory
Wave-based representations offer a natural pathway to non-coordinate-based information structuring1. In such systems, information is not stored at discrete memory addresses but is encoded in the overall pattern of interference distributed across a region or volume. This distributed nature—a hallmark of holographic systems—provides several advantages for AI:
Non-Coordinate-Based Information Structuring
: NIST's "race logic" approach encodes information in the relative arrival times of signal wavefronts rather than voltage levels1. This has shown computational efficiency for neural network layers at "one to two-order-of-magnitude lower energy cost" even with conventional integrated circuits1.
Temporal Computing
: These circuits utilize "coherent interferometer meshes, microring-resonator weight banks, and wavelength-division multiplexing schemes to perform dense matrix multiplications and multiply-accumulate operations at the speed of light"1. They demonstrate how controlled interference of light waves can perform computation directly.
Photonic Integrated Circuits
: Information can be densely encoded by modulating wave characteristics, with subsequent interference patterns representing computational results or complex data structures1. Research in Global Navigation Satellite System interference monitoring has shown that machine learning techniques like Variational Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks can extract meaningful, compressed representations from wave-based data1.
Refractive and Phase-Interference Based Encoding
Several promising research avenues demonstrate the viability of wave-based computation:
Waves offer multiple degrees of freedom for encoding information: not just amplitude, but also frequency, phase, and polarization. This multi-dimensional approach to data representation potentially allows for significantly greater information density than simple scalar values1. For an AI's internal model, this means that a single "signal" or "activation" could carry far more nuanced information, leading to more efficient and expressive internal states.
The foundation for holographically-inspired intelligence lies in computational paradigms that leverage wave phenomena—specifically wavefronts, interference, and phase—for information encoding and processing1. These approaches move beyond traditional binary logic to embrace the richer dynamics offered by wave-based systems.
Wavefronts, Interference, and Phase in Computation
Wave-Based Computational Paradigms
Furthermore, this approach could facilitate sophisticated recursive spatial perception, where the AI continuously updates its understanding of its environment through dynamic interactions between new sensory data and existing internal representations1. Unlike systems that construct static 3D models and then operate upon them, an AI with holographic internal interfaces would maintain an evolving, dynamic "worldview" crucial for navigating complex, changing environments.
A key advantage of holographic interfaces lies in their potential to support self-organizing intelligence. The distributed nature of information encoding inherent to holographic principles may enable AI systems to exhibit emergent organizational properties1. Rather than requiring explicit programming for every contingency, such systems could adapt their internal structure based on experience through wave-like interactions and interference patterns.
Self-Organizing Intelligence and Recursive Perception
This paradigm shift represents more than just a technical modification—it suggests a fundamental reconceptualization of how AI might "think." Rather than simply adding a "3D module" to existing architectures, holographically-inspired intelligence would involve reimagining the foundational mechanisms by which an AI perceives, represents, and reasons about its world1. The pursuit of such systems could potentially lead to AI with more holistic context awareness and intuitive information processing capabilities.
dimensional scenes are encoded across an entire holographic plate, where information exists as patterns of interference rather than at specific coordinates.
The development of artificial intelligence has traditionally relied on discrete, coordinate-based (XYZ) internal representations for processing and storing spatial information. However, a revolutionary approach envisions AI systems with holographic internal interfaces that process information through distributed, interference-based patterns rather than rigid compartmentalization1. This concept draws inspiration from how three-
The Vision of Holographic Internal Interfaces for AI
This comprehensive review examines the emerging field of holographically-inspired computational techniques for artificial intelligence, with particular focus on implementations for consumer hardware platforms. The integration of holographic principles into AI represents a significant paradigm shift from traditional coordinate-based data representations toward distributed, interference-based patterns that could enable more intuitive, context-aware information processing. Current research reveals promising approaches through neural holography, photonic computing, and wave-based computational paradigms that may fundamentally transform how AI systems perceive and process information, even on standard consumer hardware.

The path ahead is undeniably long and fraught with technical and theoretical hurdles. However, the convergence of ideas from optics, computer science, neuroscience, and mathematics, coupled with the relentless drive to harness the power of computation on accessible hardware, makes the future of holographic cognition an exceptionally exciting and potentially revolutionary frontier in the ongoing quest to create truly intelligent machines.

Moreover, the quest for radically different computational paradigms like holographic-inspired intelligence, often driven by the inherent limitations of current approaches and drawing inspiration from the fundamental laws of physics, could represent an unexpected yet potent route towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). As conventional scaling laws for dominant AI models encounter constraints related to data, energy consumption, and computational cost, alternative models become increasingly attractive. If holographic-inspired computation proves to be fundamentally more efficient, expressive, or scalable for certain classes of complex problems—especially those involving intricate relational structures, spatio-temporal dynamics, or holistic scene understanding—it could unlock capabilities that are currently beyond our reach. This endeavor is not merely about incremental improvements to existing AI; it is about exploring whether a different 
might prove more robust and less brittle than current approaches, particularly in the face of novel situations or adversarial perturbations that exploit the weaknesses of symbolic systems.
The pursuit of holographic cognition also carries philosophical implications. If an AI begins to "think" in a manner that is fundamentally different from current computational architectures—one based on interference, distributed representation, and emergent properties of wave interactions—it could reshape our understanding of intelligence itself. This exploration prompts a redefinition of what "understanding" might mean for an AI. A holographic AI might comprehend its environment less through explicit symbolic labeling and logical deduction, and more through the recognition, manipulation, and evolution of complex, high-dimensional interference patterns. This could be akin to a more intuitive, gestalt form of perception, where the whole of a scene or concept is grasped through the overall "shape" and dynamics of its internal representational field. Such an understanding 
The long-term vision of an AI endowed with true holographic internal thought structures is compelling. Such a system could enable more intuitive and nuanced human-AI interaction, as its internal "language" might more closely align with holistic or associative human cognitive processes. It could foster AIs with a deeper, more integrated understanding of complex spatial, temporal, and abstract domains, moving beyond current models that often excel at specific tasks but lack broad contextual awareness or robust generalization. Furthermore, new forms of machine creativity and problem-solving might emerge if an AI can manipulate and reason with information encoded in these rich, wave-like patterns.
The exploration of holographic internal interfaces for AI systems, particularly those designed to operate on conventional consumer hardware, represents a frontier rich with both profound challenges and transformative potential. This review has traced multiple threads of research—from foundational wave-based computational principles and neural network-driven holography to non-Euclidean AI models and embodied perception frameworks—that collectively illuminate pathways toward this ambitious vision. Key findings indicate that while the journey is complex, the foundational elements necessary for investigating and developing such systems are steadily emerging from diverse scientific and engineering disciplines. Promising avenues include the continued development of efficient neural approximations for wave physics, the integration of non-Euclidean geometries to create more natural internal representational spaces for relational and distributed information, the leveraging of ubiquitous consumer sensors for rich and continuous sensory input, and the collaborative advancement spurred by open-source projects and experimental platforms.

Comparative Overview of Key Research and Projects
 the update mechanism; it changes the overall pattern, thereby modifying and refining the AI's internal model. This conceptualization is fundamentally different from merely appending data to a database or re-meshing a 3D scene; it suggests a more organic, holistic, and continuously adaptive form of learning and representation.
is
Ultimately, the synthesis of these diverse research threads points towards an AI whose understanding of the world is not a static database or a fixed 3D geometric model, but rather a dynamic, constantly evolving interference pattern. This pattern would be generated by the continuous interaction of incoming sensory input (itself converted into a wave-like format) with the AI's stored experiences and knowledge, which are also encoded as interference patterns. Recursive spatial perception, in this view, becomes a process where new "wavefronts" of sensory data interfere with the existing internal "hologram"—the AI's current understanding of the world. This interference process 
A key aspiration of a self-organizing, holographically-inspired system is the potential for emergent behaviors and understanding that are not explicitly programmed. This is a powerful prospect, as an AI whose internal "thoughts" emerge from complex wave interactions might develop novel solutions or insights. However, this also carries the risk of unpredictability and opacity. If the internal workings become too complex and distributed to be easily interpretable, challenges related to debugging, verification, and ensuring alignment with human values and intentions could arise, echoing concerns about AI control and human-AI relationships.   
The relationship between the desired holographic representation and the computational methods needed to support it is intricate, resembling a "chicken and egg" scenario. The envisioned representation requires specific computational operations (e.g., simulating interference, propagating wavefronts), yet existing consumer hardware is not inherently optimized for large-scale wave optics. This necessitates the development of new algorithms, such as neural approximations or efficient simulation techniques like Gaussian Wave Splatting , to perform these computations. Success in these computational methods might, in turn, enable the creation of even richer or more complex holographic representations than initially conceived, creating a positive feedback loop of co-development.   
 Advancing the mathematical and conceptual underpinnings of what it means for an AI to process information, learn, reason, and "think" using principles derived from holography and wave physics.
Theoretical Framework for "Holographic Cognition":
 Investigating how algorithms for wave-like computations can be optimally mapped to the diverse architectures of consumer processing units (CPUs, GPUs, NPUs) to maximize efficiency and throughput.
Hardware-Software Co-design (even for Simulation):
 Creating methods that enable AIs to learn useful, robust, and efficient holographic or wave-like internal models from unlabeled sensory data, particularly from continuous video streams or multi-modal sensor inputs from consumer devices.
Self-Supervised Learning for Holographic Representations:
 Designing neural networks whose inherent structure, connectivity, and operations are based on non-Euclidean geometries that are well-suited to representing wave interactions, distributed information, and relational structures.
Non-Euclidean Neural Architectures:
 Developing novel neural network architectures and training methodologies specifically designed to very efficiently simulate, represent, or learn the outcomes of wavefront propagation and interference for large-scale internal models.
Efficient Neural Approximations of Wave Propagation:
To advance towards this vision, focused research in several key areas is recommended:
Recommendations for Promising Research Directions
wavefronts interact with existing memory traces (themselves encoded as complex interference patterns), leading to continuous learning and adaptation.
 The AI's memory might not be a passive repository of stored data but an active computational medium where incoming information 
Memory as an Active Medium:
 AI components could be trained to efficiently simulate or approximate the necessary wave physics or optical transformations, acting as specialized "physics engines" within the larger cognitive architecture.
Learned Simulators:
 Combining the strengths of traditional symbolic reasoning or established neural network architectures with the novel capabilities of sub-symbolic holographic/wave-based representations could offer a pragmatic path forward.
Hybrid Models:
 A multi-layered architecture could be envisaged. Lower levels might handle raw sensor data processing and the initial construction of basic wavefronts or lightfield elements. Middle layers could perform more complex interference-based computations and spatial modeling, perhaps operating within learned non-Euclidean spaces. Higher levels could then deal with more abstract reasoning, goal formulation, and decision-making based on the patterns emerging from the underlying holographic representations.
Hierarchical Systems:
Addressing these challenges might involve exploring novel AI architectures:
Potential Architectural Considerations
 As the complexity of perceived environments and the desired sophistication of internal representations increase, how do these wave-inspired approaches scale without exceeding the computational and memory limitations of consumer hardware?
Scalability:
 While datasets exist for specific sub-tasks like CGH generation (e.g., MIT-CGH-4K ), training an end-to-end system capable of recursive spatial perception and genuinely holographic internal thought would likely require new, comprehensive datasets capturing dynamic interactions in complex environments. Alternatively, highly effective unsupervised or self-supervised learning methods capable of discovering these representations from raw sensory experience will be essential.   
Data Scarcity for Holistic Training:
 The concept of "holographic thought structuring" is still largely metaphorical and nascent. What does it truly mean for an AI to "think" holographically? How are fundamental cognitive processes such as reasoning, planning, learning, and decision-making performed within such a paradigm? A robust theoretical framework is currently lacking.
Theoretical Gaps in "Holographic Cognition":
 Weaving together neural networks, wave physics simulations (or their approximations), non-Euclidean geometric concepts, and real-time multi-sensor fusion into a coherent, functioning system is a monumental engineering and research undertaking. How, for instance, does a "neural holographic field" interact with a "temporal computing" module, or how are non-Euclidean embeddings utilized within a wavefront processing pipeline?
Integration of Disparate Techniques:
 The accurate simulation of wave optics phenomena (diffraction, interference) for complex scenes in real-time remains immensely challenging on standard CPUs and GPUs. While neural approximations and clever algorithms offer paths forward, achieving the necessary balance of fidelity and performance for a rich internal holographic model is a primary hurdle.
Computational Cost on Consumer Hardware:
Despite the promising advancements, formidable challenges remain:
Identifying Key Challenges
 For reliable operation on diverse and potentially imperfect consumer hardware in uncontrolled real-world environments, self-mapping and calibration capabilities are crucial. AI-driven calibration techniques and inherently calibration-lite methods like neural network-enhanced self-interference digital holography are vital for an AI that needs to autonomously adapt to its sensory apparatus and maintain perceptual accuracy.   
Adaptability and Robustness:
 The AI must be able to perceive its environment using sensors available on consumer platforms. Systems that derive depth and spatial understanding from 2D sensors (e.g., SpatialBot using RGB-D from webcams/MDE , markerless motion capture from RGB cameras ), when integrated with frameworks for recursive perception using smartphones and IoT devices (as suggested by trends in XR , spatial computing , and the Internet of Agents ), can provide the continuous, rich sensory input necessary for the AI to build and update its internal holographic model of the world.   
Perception and Interaction:
 To move beyond simple geometric descriptions, the AI's internal spatial model may benefit from non-Euclidean geometries and topological approaches. These mathematical frameworks can more naturally capture the relational and structural complexities of real-world environments and the distributed nature of holographic information, potentially forming a more expressive "language" for spatial reasoning than traditional XYZ coordinate systems.   
Spatial "Language" and Reasoning:
 The manipulation and processing of these holographic representations necessitate novel computational mechanisms. Wavefront computing principles, as demonstrated in NIST's Temporal Computing , phase-interference based encoding explored in GNSS signal processing and photonic neural networks , and the simulated optical computations in projects like the Unified Holographic Neural Network , provide foundational ideas for how such computations might be realized or efficiently approximated on electronic hardware.   
Computational Principles:
 The core of a holographic AI lies in its internal representation of information and space. Neural holography techniques , lightfield AI , and advanced volumetric methods offer promising avenues for learning compact yet rich 3D and 4D scene representations directly from 2D or RGB-D inputs. These learned representations, such as the anisotropic 3D Gaussian primitives found in Neural Holographic Fields and Gaussian Wave Splatting , or the PlenOctree data structures used by VistaFlow , could form the basis of the AI's "holographic thought structures." These structures are not just static models but are learned, often encoding view-dependent effects and complex light interactions.   
Internal Representation:
The development of such an AI system requires the convergence of multiple technological and conceptual advancements:
Connecting the Threads: How Diverse Research Areas Inform the User's Goal
The preceding sections have surveyed a diverse array of research areas, from wave-based computational principles and neural holography to non-Euclidean AI models and embodied perception on consumer devices. Synthesizing these threads reveals potential pathways—and significant challenges—towards the ambitious goal of a self-organizing, holographically-inspired intelligence operating on conventional consumer platforms.
VII. Synthesis: Towards a Self-Organizing, Holographically-Inspired Intelligence
on accessible hardware platforms is pushing innovation in algorithmic efficiency and novel system design. Projects like Tensor Holography (designed to run on a laptop ) and VistaFlow (demonstrating performance on integrated graphics ), along with the use of smartphone cameras as input sources for sophisticated 3D capture or as nodes in broader IoT perception frameworks , clearly emphasize this movement. This trend is essential for realizing the vision of an AI system operating pervasively on "conventional consumer computational platforms," implying that the necessary building blocks—both hardware and software—are becoming increasingly democratized and capable.   
A strong and discernible trend is the "consumerization" of advanced optical and holographic concepts. Many of these projects explicitly target or leverage consumer-grade components such as GPUs, webcams, and smartphones. The drive to make complex techniques like real-time holography or detailed volumetric reconstruction work effectively 
The landscape of these projects and systems reveals a spectrum of development, ranging from pure simulation of optical principles on digital hardware (e.g., the Unified Holographic Neural Network ) to systems employing real optical components and sensors (e.g., the Open Source Lightfield Camera , SIDH microscopy ), and extending to complete display systems (e.g., Voxon VX2 , WayRay displays ). This spectrum indicates a maturation pathway where concepts can be rigorously explored and de-risked in simulation before commitment to physical hardware, and where insights from hardware experiments can, in turn, inform and refine simulation models. An AI with a holographic internal model might initially be developed entirely within a simulated environment, with the potential for specific computational components to be offloaded to specialized co-processors if the underlying principles prove effective and efficient hardware becomes available.   
The proliferation of open-source projects in areas like neural holography and lightfield processing is significantly accelerating innovation at the intersection of AI and optics. Codebases such as those for Tensor Holography , the Unified Holographic Neural Network , and Gaussian Wave Splatting substantially lower the barrier to entry for researchers and developers. This allows for faster iteration, experimentation with novel variations, and a focus on new conceptual advancements rather than re-implementing foundational algorithms from scratch, fostering a more rapid evolution in this highly interdisciplinary field.   
 WayRay specializes in developing holographic Augmented Reality (AR) displays, particularly for the automotive industry, using proprietary holographic optical elements (HOEs). Their technology focuses on seamlessly integrating virtual information into the real world at variable depths. Again, while display-oriented, WayRay's work pushes the boundaries of practical, compact holographic systems and demonstrates the application of advanced holographic materials and design.   
WayRay Holographic AR Displays:
Unity or custom code. Notably, it has been integrated with AI to create "Genie," an AI-driven 3D holographic chatbot, demonstrating the convergence of AI with advanced volumetric display technologies. While a display technology, the VX2 illustrates the kind of interactive, three-dimensional output one might envision from a sophisticated holographic system and highlights the drive for real-time interaction.   
 This commercially available display creates true volumetric 3D images, often described as holograms, that are viewable from 360 degrees without requiring special eyewear. It generates these images using millions of points of light that physically occupy a volume in space. The system can be controlled by a connected PC and supports interactive applications developed in 
Voxon Photonics VX2 Volumetric Display:
 Existing consumer XR headsets (e.g., from Meta, HTC, Apple) serve as important experimental platforms. They integrate many of the requisite sensors (cameras, depth sensors, IMUs) and are actively grappling with challenges related to computational load distribution, real-time environmental mapping, and intuitive user interfaces for spatial computing. These platforms are driving innovation in efficient spatial perception on consumer-grade hardware.   
Consumer XR Systems:
 Experimental realizations of on-chip optical computations using coherent interferometer meshes and microring resonator-based weight banks on PICs, as well as metasurface-based optical processors, prove the physical feasibility of performing neural network operations directly with light waves. While not yet consumer hardware, these systems are crucial for validating the fundamental principles of optical and wave-based computation.   
Photonic Neural Networks:
 Experimental setups have successfully demonstrated non-scanning, calibration-lite volumetric fluorescence microscopy by using a single 2D self-interference hologram as input to a 3D neural network for reconstruction. This showcases the potential of combining interference optics with deep learning for efficient 3D sensing without complex hardware.   
Self-Interference Digital Holography with 3D Neural Networks:
 Experimental validation of "race logic" on conventional integrated circuits has demonstrated significant energy savings (one to two orders of magnitude) for implementing neural network components like convolutional layers, achieving accuracy close to state-of-the-art for certain tasks. This provides empirical evidence for the efficiency of wavefront computing principles in electronics.   
NIST's Temporal Computing:
Beyond open-source software, several experimental systems and commercial products demonstrate the practical application of the principles relevant to holographic AI:
Highlighting Experimental Systems Demonstrating Key Concepts
algorithms for manipulating lightfield data and creating 3D views, along with their published research and datasets, can inform and inspire open-source efforts in lightfield processing and AI.   
 While the Realception® Plug-Ins for Nuke and Unreal Engine are commercial software tools for professional movie post-production using lightfield and multi-camera data, Fraunhofer IIS also contributes to the academic community through publications and datasets. These plug-ins offer advanced features like virtual camera perspective shifts from stationary camera footage by leveraging depth information. The underlying 
Fraunhofer IIS Realception® Plug-Ins and Datasets:
 An ongoing project focuses on developing an open-source framework for constructing lightfield (plenoptic) cameras at a significantly lower cost than commercially available options. The project includes an online optical design tool, a parametric mechanical design framework (using Solidworks) that can generate CAD files based on optical parameters, and a built prototype. This initiative addresses the hardware capture side for lightfield data, providing an accessible means to acquire the rich directional light information essential for developing and testing lightfield AI algorithms on consumer platforms.   
Open Source Lightfield Camera:
 The project page for GWS and its associated arXiv paper indicate the availability of source code on GitHub (specifically, github.com/computational-imaging/hsplat is mentioned in related contexts ). GWS converts Gaussian scene representations, derived from neural rendering of photographs, into holograms. It employs a mathematically derived Gaussian-to-hologram transform and utilizes custom CUDA kernels for an efficient Fourier domain approximation of the process. This project offers an open-source pathway from 2D images to holograms via an intermediate neural scene representation (the Gaussians), with a focus on computational efficiency through CUDA.   
Gaussian Wave Splatting (GWS) Code:
 The work by Shi et al. on Tensor Holography is accompanied by a GitHub repository (liangs111/tensor_holography) that provides code for their influential publications in Nature (2021) and Light: Science & Applications (2022). This repository includes implementations of the CNNs used for real-time generation of 3D phase-only holograms from RGB-D input. The code is designed to run with Python and TensorFlow, and it offers options for TensorRT accelerated inference, enhancing performance on NVIDIA GPUs. While primarily focused on display applications, the efficient network architectures and the handling of the MIT-CGH-4K dataset (which is also available) provide valuable insights into practical neural holography.   
Tensor Holography Codebase:
open-source nature make it a highly relevant platform for experimentation with phase-interference techniques.   
 This project, available on GitHub, explicitly aims to combine holographic memory, neural networks, and optical computing principles. It utilizes ray tracing, accelerated by NVIDIA RTX RT Cores for ray-triangle intersection tests and CUDA Tensor Cores for neural network matrix operations, to simulate the propagation of light through optical elements modeled with refractive/diffractive surfaces and phase functions. The system simulates wave propagation effects and interference patterns critical for holographic computations. It features a frontend built with React and Three.js for 3D visualization, a Node.js backend, and incorporates P2P networking capabilities using WebRTC. Its direct attempt to simulate holographic neural computation on consumer GPUs and its 
Unified Holographic Neural Network:
Several open-source initiatives offer valuable resources for researchers and developers in this domain:
Review of Relevant Open-Source Projects
The exploration of holographic internal interfaces and related computational paradigms is significantly bolstered by open-source projects and experimental systems that provide practical tools, demonstrate key concepts, and push the boundaries of what is achievable, often with consumer-grade hardware.
VI. Open Source Initiatives and Experimental Implementations
Finally, the "recursive" nature of perception in this context implies more than just data accumulation; it signifies active model refinement. New sensory data does not simply get appended to a static list or database. Instead, it actively interacts with and modifies the AI's internal holographic model. This process is analogous to how new experiences continuously shape understanding and refine mental models in biological systems. In a holographic AI, this update mechanism could be conceptualized as new incoming "wavefronts" of sensory information interfering with the existing internal "hologram"—which represents the AI's current understanding of the world. This interference pattern dynamically changes, leading to an evolved and refined internal model. Such dynamic refinement is crucial for an AI that must deal effectively with changing environments, learn from ongoing interactions, and maintain an accurate and relevant understanding of its operational context over time.
interference holography inherently reduces calibration complexity by employing a common optical path for the interfering waves. An AI system that can self-calibrate or operate effectively with minimal calibration is inherently more autonomous, adaptable, and deployable, aligning closely with the "self-organizing" and "self-mapping holography" aspects of the desired intelligence.   
The trend towards AI-driven calibration and the development of calibration-lite systems like neural network-enhanced SIDH are critical for enabling robust AI operation on the diverse and often imperfect hardware found in consumer electronics. Manual calibration is impractical for widespread AI deployment in uncontrolled real-world settings. A truly self-organizing AI should possess the ability to understand, adapt to, and potentially even learn the characteristics of its own sensory apparatus. Machine learning techniques are already being used to automate calibration processes or to develop models that can compensate for uncalibrated data, such as neural networks learning optical propagation models. Self-
 of collaborating devices. Each device (smartphones, wearables, IoT gadgets), while individually possessing limited sensing capabilities and a restricted viewpoint, could contribute its partial sensory input to the collective. An AI with a holographic internal model could then fuse these distributed "wavefronts" of information, allowing them to interfere and coalesce into a more complete, robust, and multi-perspective internal representation of space. This could lead to a decentralized yet coherent recursive perception system, where the AI's understanding is continuously enriched by the diverse inputs from its networked sensor ecosystem.   
network
The convergence of the Internet of Agents (IoA) concept with the ubiquity of sensor-equipped consumer devices points towards a future where a holographically-inspired AI might perceive its environment not merely through a single set of sensors, but through a dynamic 
In SIDH, a wavefront from the object interferes with a part of itself (e.g., an undiffracted portion or a reference wave derived from the source illumination), encoding 3D information into the resulting 2D interference pattern. The neural network then learns to reconstruct the 3D volume directly from this self-interference pattern. This process effectively allows the network to "decode" the depth information without requiring explicit scanning of the object or complex calibration procedures involving multiple optical components or precise alignments. The use of a 3D neural network architecture has been shown to significantly enhance resolution in all three spatial dimensions compared to conventional reconstruction methods or 2D neural network approaches. This methodology is highly attractive for developing self-contained AI systems on consumer hardware, as it reduces reliance on complex, precisely calibrated multi-sensor arrays.

 A particularly promising approach for achieving robust 3D perception with minimal calibration overhead is self-interference digital holography (SIDH), especially when augmented by deep learning.
Self-Interference Holography for Non-Scanning, Calibration-Lite Systems:
Industry efforts, such as those by Keysight in AI infrastructure testing, include the development of "automated calibration, probing, and measurement solutions" for optoelectrical devices , indicating a broader trend towards robust and automated calibration procedures for the hardware underpinning AI systems.   
The field of quantum computing, though distinct, offers analogous insights. Machine learning algorithms are being employed to "model and mitigate noise, automate qubit calibration, and optimize gate operations," with the observation that "this ability to automate system setup and calibration is essential" for accelerating experimentation and prototyping. The principle of AI-driven automation of calibration is broadly applicable to complex sensor systems on consumer devices, where manual calibration is often impractical.

Neural holography research has introduced "learned camera-calibrated propagation models" and "gradient-based camera-calibration techniques paired with new optical system designs" to achieve high image quality and enable compact displays. This suggests that AI can 
In XR systems, "precise calibration and registration are paramount, encompassing spatial alignment, accurate color reproduction, distortion correction, and dynamic registration to seamlessly merge the virtual and real". While this primarily refers to display calibration in XR, the underlying principle of accurately calibrating sensors to the physical world and to each other is fundamental for any AI that relies on those sensors for spatial understanding and action.   
 The process by which an AI understands the relationship between its sensor readings and the physical world, and potentially its own internal representational space (or "phase-space"), is critical.
Hardware Calibration for Internal Phase-Space:
For an AI to reliably interpret sensory data from diverse consumer hardware, which can vary in quality and be subject to environmental influences, robust self-mapping and calibration mechanisms are essential.
Self-Mapping and Calibration
 The core idea of a live, recursive framework is that the AI is not merely constructing a one-time map or model of its surroundings. Instead, it is engaged in a continuous process of updating its internal spatial model based on the constant influx of new sensory information from these consumer devices. Each new observation can be conceptualized as "interfering" with the AI's existing internal "hologram," thereby refining, correcting, and evolving its understanding of the world. This dynamic updating is crucial for any embodied AI that needs to navigate, interact with, and adapt to complex, real-world environments that are rarely static.
Live, Recursive Framework:
 touches upon the increasing agentic capabilities of AI. As AI becomes more "personalised (i.e., adapted to a single user)" and "agentic (i.e., able to autonomously perform tasks on that user's behalf)," such AI systems, potentially operating on personal devices, will require robust spatial perception to effectively perform tasks within the user's physical environment.   
human-AI relationships
Even research into 
 framework proposes an infrastructure for interconnected AI agents, which could include those running on mobile devices and UAVs. This framework can empower "resource-constrained agents... with access to advanced AI capabilities and beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) perception". Within an IoA, agents can self-organize, collaborate, and share sensory information. This is highly pertinent to creating a distributed, recursive perception system that leverages multiple IoT devices or smartphones. Key features of IoA, such as "evolving agent capability" based on context and "real-time workflow reconfiguration," are essential for dynamic spatial understanding in changing environments.   
Internet of Agents (IoA)
The 
 further underscores this. It is argued that AI's next significant advancement will be powered by hardware that allows it to move into physical spaces. "AI needs spatial intelligence – an awareness of physical space – to reach its potential," and devices like AR glasses, AI-powered headsets, and smart rings or watches are enabling AI to interpret gestures, movements, and environmental context more naturally. These devices are crucial for gathering diverse spatial data—including depth, motion, object recognition, and environmental mapping—in real-time. This direct interaction with the world allows AI to learn and adapt continuously, which is the essence of recursive perception.

 exemplifies this trend, with devices incorporating outward-facing RGB cameras, depth sensors (such as structured light, Time-of-Flight (ToF), or LiDAR), and inward-facing cameras for tracking hand positions and gestures. These sensor suites are becoming standard in consumer-facing XR hardware. The notion of "spatial intelligence," where XR aims to establish a "brand-new space in digits with realistic experience," is highly relevant. To manage

 Consumer devices are increasingly equipped with a variety of sensors that can provide the raw data for such perception.
The Role of Ubiquitous Sensors:
The concept of recursive spatial perception involves an AI continuously updating its internal model of the environment and its own state within that environment based on an ongoing stream of sensory input. This is a dynamic process, far removed from static map-building.
Recursive Spatial Perception with Consumer Devices
For a holographically-inspired intelligence to be truly effective, especially one operating on consumer hardware, it must be capable of perceiving and interacting with the physical world. This necessitates robust mechanisms for recursive spatial perception using ubiquitous sensors, alongside sophisticated self-mapping and calibration capabilities to ensure reliable operation in diverse and uncontrolled environments.
V. Embodiment and Perception on Consumer Platforms
The ability to derive rich 3D understanding from standard 2D sensors, such as webcams and smartphone cameras, through techniques like Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE), and then to feed this information into systems like SpatialBot , is paramount for making advanced spatial AI capabilities accessible on ubiquitous consumer devices. Specialized 3D sensors like LiDAR or high-end depth cameras are not universally available. In contrast, RGB cameras are pervasive. MDE allows for the inference of depth from a single 2D image, and systems like SpatialBot can leverage this by processing RGB-D data where the depth component (D) can be sourced from MDE. This democratization of the input side of the holographic AI vision means that the rich spatial data required for such an system could potentially be sourced from the vast majority of existing consumer devices, significantly broadening the potential reach and applicability of such an AI.   
and robust form of spatial understanding, one that is less susceptible to minor variations in input data (e.g., slight changes in viewpoint or object position). This aligns with the holographic concept of capturing the "essence" or global structure of a scene rather than merely a collection of discrete points. The demonstrated "damage tolerance" of TMNNs is a direct illustration of the robustness that topological principles can confer.   
Furthermore, topological approaches, as hinted at by TMNNs and SOMs , emphasize properties that are preserved under continuous deformation, such as connectedness or containment. This focus on invariant properties could form the basis for a more abstract 
The adoption of non-Euclidean geometries for AI could be seen as providing a more "natural language" for representing the relational information inherent in holographic thought. If an AI is to grasp complex relationships, hierarchies, and contextual nuances, non-Euclidean frameworks might offer a more fundamental mathematical underpinning than Euclidean space, which excels primarily at defining rigid, absolute positions. Holographic principles themselves are deeply relational, with interference patterns arising from the phase relationships between interacting waves. Thus, an AI striving for holographic internal processing might find that its internal "phase space" or "interference field," where these relationships are computed and represented, is more aptly described by non-Euclidean geometries.   
 comprehends space through learned patterns of interaction, potentially akin to interference patterns or wavefront dynamics, rather than by exhaustively calculating and storing XYZ coordinates for every element in its perceived environment. These 2D-to-3D understanding systems serve as vital stepping stones in this direction.
intrinsically
While systems like SpatialBot might ultimately output coordinate-based descriptions, the internal processing required to, for example, determine "which object is closer" from RGB-D data could involve learning implicit spatial relationships that are not solely driven by explicit coordinate calculations. The overarching goal is to progress towards an AI that 
 While ELMO utilizes LiDAR (a depth sensor less common in general consumer devices but prevalent in some areas like automotive and robotics) to upsample low-framerate point cloud sequences for real-time motion capture, the paper discusses the broader context of motion capture sensors. It notes that standard RGB cameras and inertial sensors often lack explicit information on global translation, leading to drift in pose estimation. In contrast, depth sensors like RGB-D cameras and LiDAR can enhance global tracking, though they may suffer from noise (RGB-D) or low framerates (LiDAR). The paper also acknowledges the significant research attention on markerless motion capture methods that use widely available devices such as webcams and RGB cameras, highlighting the drive towards enhancing accessibility.

 Aims to use depth information for more complex tasks like grounding objects in the scene, counting objects, and determining more abstract spatial and positional relationships. This work is significant as it explicitly targets the teaching of spatial reasoning to VLMs using depth data obtainable from consumer-grade sensors. While the output might still involve explicit depth values or object locations (which can be translated to XYZ coordinates), the internal 
High-level understanding:
 Focuses on proximity relationships (e.g., determining which point is closer or further away), describing the depth characteristics of objects or regions (e.g., using center point depth, minimum, maximum, or mean depth), and understanding proximity relationships between different objects.
Mid-level understanding:
 Involves interpreting raw depth values and relating point coordinates in space to pixels in the image.
Low-level understanding:
 This project aims to enhance the spatial understanding of Vision Language Models (VLMs) by providing them with both RGB and depth image inputs. To facilitate this, the researchers have curated datasets like SpatialQA (for RGB-D question answering) and SpatialBench (for evaluating spatial understanding). A key strategy is the use of RGB-D cameras, which are becoming increasingly common and affordable, particularly in robotics, or the application of Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) techniques to convert standard RGB image datasets into RGB-D datasets. This directly aligns with the goal of using standard 2D sensors. SpatialBot is trained to understand spatial concepts at multiple levels:

Depth-Encoding and Viewpoint-Variable Systems:
A critical aspect of developing AI with advanced spatial awareness on consumer hardware is the ability to derive rich 3D understanding from readily available 2D sensors, such as webcams and smartphone cameras.
Implicit Spatial Understanding from 2D Sensors
 As previously discussed, photonic neural networks that use components like metasurfaces inherently perform computation via diffraction and interference of light waves. Multilayer diffractive architectures, where stacked 2D metasurfaces act as neuron layers, create a physical neural topology where computation is a direct result of wave interaction. This serves as a hardware example of a non-coordinate-based computational structure whose behavior is governed by wave physics.   
Photonic Neural Networks and Metasurfaces:
 MicroCloud Hologram Inc. reports the development of a Q-SOM, which integrates classical Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOM) neural networks with quantum computing capabilities. SOMs are unsupervised learning models that map high-dimensional input data onto a lower-dimensional topological space, preserving the similarity relationships present in the input data. While the "quantum-assisted" aspect may currently exceed typical consumer hardware capabilities, the foundational use of SOMs—which are inherently about learning and representing topological relationships in data—is pertinent. The company's additional work on "holographic digital twin technology" also suggests an interest in advanced spatial modeling.   
Quantum-Assisted Self-Organizing Feature Maps (Q-SOMs):
 Research into TMNNs, inspired by phenomena like the quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) in topological metamaterials, demonstrates one such avenue. These networks utilize pseudospin states and leverage the robustness conferred by the QSHE, making them inherently damage-tolerant for tasks like binary classification. The "topological protection" ensures that localized damage or perturbations have minimal impact on the overall function, as waves in the inference process are guided along topologically protected pathways and barely scatter into the bulk material. While this specific example is mechanical, the core principle of harnessing topological properties for robust and efficient computation is highly relevant.   
Topological Mechanical Neural Networks (TMNNs):
 Beyond abstract geometries, some neural network architectures draw inspiration from physical systems exhibiting interesting topological properties or wave-like behaviors.
Neural Topologies and Physical Process-Inspired Networks:
For an AI aiming to develop a holographic or wave-inspired internal model, which inherently deals with relationships, interference phenomena, and distributed information, non-Euclidean geometries could offer a more natural and powerful mathematical framework than rigid XYZ coordinates. The "shape" or manifold of the AI's internal "phase space," where information wavefronts interact, might be more accurately described by non-Euclidean metrics.
 Strategies for integrating non-Euclidean geometries into foundation models include fine-tuning existing models, training new models from scratch using geometric principles, and developing hybrid approaches that combine Euclidean and non-Euclidean components. Furthermore, the concept of task-aware adaptability—where embeddings dynamically reconfigure to match the geometry of downstream applications—is proposed to enhance efficiency and expressivity.   
Methods for Integration into AI Models:
 Graphs, cellular complexes, and hypergraphs, which relax the assumption of a regular grid and allow for the representation of more complex relationships and connectivity patterns between data points. These structures emphasize properties like connectedness and adjacency.   
Topological Structures:
 Spheres, hyperbolic spaces, and tori, which relax the assumption of flatness inherent in Euclidean space and can exhibit positive or negative curvature. Hyperbolic spaces, for example, are particularly well-suited for representing hierarchical data.   
Curved Spaces:
 The types of non-Euclidean geometries and alternative data structures being explored include:
Proposed Geometries and Structures:
This perspective echoes the transformative shifts in mathematics during the 19th century, which saw the development of non-Euclidean geometries, topology, and abstract algebra. These fields provided new tools to understand phenomena that did not fit neatly into the Euclidean framework, such as the curvature of spacetime or the complex interactions between neurons. Modern machine learning is now beginning to embrace these broader mathematical perspectives to extract knowledge from richly structured, non-Euclidean data.   
 The de facto geometric setting for most machine learning architectures has been Euclidean space. However, a growing body of literature argues that this choice imposes fundamental limitations when dealing with complex, real-world data. Data across various domains, including language, vision, and the natural sciences, often exhibit inherently non-Euclidean structures such as multi-way relationships, hierarchies, symmetries, and non-isotropic scaling. Effectively capturing these intricate structures within the constraints of Euclidean spaces proves challenging. Consequently, moving beyond Euclidean geometry is increasingly viewed not merely as an optional enhancement but as a necessity for the continued advancement and scaling of next-generation foundation models. By adopting non-Euclidean geometries, AI models could more efficiently leverage these inherent structural properties of data.   
The Argument for Moving Beyond Euclidean Geometry:
Non-Euclidean and Topological Representations in AI
The ambition to create AI with holographic internal interfaces naturally leads to questioning the suitability of traditional, Euclidean coordinate-based (XYZ) spatial models. If an AI is to "think" in terms of distributed interference patterns and wavefronts, its internal "language" for space might need to be more flexible and relational. This section explores approaches that move beyond Euclidean norms, leveraging non-Euclidean geometries, topological concepts, and implicit spatial understanding derived from common 2D sensors.
IV. Crafting Internal Spatial Models Without Traditional Coordinates
 3D information (e.g., holograms, volumetric video), the internal representations they learn or utilize offer profound implications for AI. The compact tensor network in Tensor Holography , the Gaussian primitives in NHFs and GWS , the PlenOctrees in VistaFlow , and the 4D Gaussians in BEAM are all novel forms of 3D or 4D scene understanding. These representations, initially optimized for rendering, inherently capture salient 3D structures, appearances, and sometimes view-dependent effects. Such learned structures could be repurposed or co-opted to serve as an AI's own internal model of the world, used for reasoning, prediction, or planning, rather than solely for visualization. The AI's "holographic thought" could, therefore, be based on the manipulation and interaction of these learned, rich scene representations.   
displaying
Crucially, while many of these projects are primarily aimed at 
The success of many of these neural methods, however, hinges on the availability of large, high-quality datasets. The MIT-CGH-4K dataset was instrumental for Tensor Holography , and the hybrid lightfield dataset was key for the unsupervised super-resolution work. The effort required to create such specialized datasets can be a significant bottleneck. Consequently, methods that can learn effectively from less data, unlabeled data (as in unsupervised learning ), or easily acquired data (such as casual smartphone captures used by NHFs ) are highly valuable for broader progress and for AIs that need to learn and adapt in novel environments without extensive pre-existing datasets.   
A common thread across these neural approaches to holography and lightfield synthesis is the concept of "learned physics." Neural networks in these domains are not merely performing pattern matching; they are, in effect, learning to approximate or efficiently compute complex physical processes such as light propagation, diffraction, and volumetric rendering. This capability allows them to bypass computationally expensive brute-force simulations, which is essential for real-time performance on consumer hardware. For example, Tensor Holography learns to generate holograms , VistaFlow learns volumetric reconstruction , and Neural Holographic Fields learn aspects of light wave propagation.   
location + 2D viewing direction). While NeRFs themselves can be computationally demanding, they offer a potent method for learning implicit 3D scene models. The concept of a "neural continuous volume representation network for each scene" is a significant step towards learned internal models. Related research, such as Generative Query Networks (GQN), also takes varying numbers of images and their corresponding camera parameters as input, encoding complete scene information into a vector that is then used by a generative network to produce novel, correctly occluded views.   
 and their extensions represent a powerful class of techniques for learning 3D scene representations from 2D images. NeRFs typically use a deep neural network to generate a volumetric "radiance field," which assigns a color and density value to every point in a 3D space, conditioned on a 5D coordinate (3D spatial 
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs)
 project focuses on producing relightable volumetric videos from multi-view RGB footage by bridging 4D Gaussian representations with physically-based rendering (PBR) principles. The pipeline robustly recovers detailed geometry and decouples PBR material properties (such as ambient occlusion, roughness, and base color) using a combination of rasterization, performance tracking, and a tailored Gaussian-based ray tracer for efficient visibility computation. While the emphasis is on video and relighting (which often implies traditional rendering aspects), the use of 4D Gaussians as a dynamic scene representation and the methodology for decoupling material properties from multi-view RGB input are pertinent. The "Gaussian-based ray tracer for efficient visibility computation" could inspire the development of efficient internal spatial query mechanisms for an AI.   
BEAM
The 
 is another relevant project that reconstructs interactive 3D volumetric images from a set of 2D photographs. It employs a differentiable rendering system and utilizes the PlenOctree data structure, notably bypassing the often more computationally intensive Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). A key innovation in VistaFlow is the QuiQ controller, an intermediate video controller trained via Q-learning, which dynamically manages render resolution to maintain consistently high framerates. Significantly, VistaFlow is designed to run natively on integrated CPU graphics, making it viable for mobile and entry-level devices, where it can outperform NeRF-based methods. This achievement in photorealistic volumetric reconstruction on highly accessible hardware makes the PlenOctree representation and dynamic resolution management highly relevant for an AI's internal spatial model on consumer platforms.   
VistaFlow
capable of simultaneously recording a 4D lightfield image and a high-resolution 2D image. Using this hybrid lightfield dataset, an unsupervised learning-based super-resolution framework is proposed. This framework adaptively addresses the lightfield spatial super-resolution problem, even with complex degradation models, by using specially designed loss functions based on pre-trained models. These loss functions enable the network to learn detailed features and the parallax structure inherent in lightfields using only a single high-resolution 2D image as ground truth for the central sub-aperture view. The development of such hardware (potentially constructible with accessible optical components) and unsupervised software aims to significantly promote the application of lightfield super-resolution. Unsupervised learning is particularly valuable as it reduces the dependency on large, meticulously labeled datasets.

unsupervised learning for high-resolution lightfield imaging
One approach involves 
Lightfields capture richer spatial information than conventional 2D images by recording the direction of light rays, not just their intensity. AI techniques are increasingly used to reconstruct, super-resolve, or interpret lightfield and volumetric data, often aiming for 3D understanding without relying on traditional, explicit 3D rendering pipelines.

 have been developed. HoloSR is an encoder-decoder deep learning network designed for hologram super-resolution. It can enhance the display size and angle-of-view achievable from lower-resolution holograms, which is practical since generating very high-resolution holograms directly can be computationally prohibitive. HoloSR also utilizes the MIT-CGH-4K dataset for training.   
HoloSR
To address resolution limitations in holographic displays, methods like 
, such as holographic glasses. These algorithms address challenges related to image quality, computational efficiency, and the physical form factor of display devices. Techniques like "learned camera-calibrated propagation models" and "gradient-based camera-calibration techniques" are employed to enhance image quality and enable the design of ultra-thin holographic displays. This aspect of self-calibration, where the system learns to adapt to or correct for its own optical characteristics, is particularly important for systems intended to operate reliably in real-world environments using imperfect consumer hardware.   
ultra-compact holographic displays
Neural holography algorithms are also instrumental in creating 
, developed by Choi, Wetzstein, and team, offers an efficient algorithm to convert these representations (often optimized from photographs using neural rendering techniques) into holograms. GWS derives a closed-form solution for a 2D Gaussian-to-hologram transform that supports accurate occlusions and view-dependent effects through a wave-optics counterpart of alpha blending, termed "alpha wave blending". For computational efficiency, a fast variant using Fourier domain approximation and custom CUDA kernels has been developed. This work directly bridges advanced neural rendering—which excels at creating efficient 3D scene representations from 2D images—with holographic display technology. While primarily display-focused, the underlying rich Gaussian representation learned from photographs constitutes a sophisticated internal model. Source code for GWS has also been made available.   
Gaussian Wave Splatting (GWS)
Building upon Gaussian scene representations, 
, by Peng, Wetzstein, and collaborators. NHFs train a neural network to generate holograms that can be viewed from any perspective within a scene, using only sparse 2D photographs, such as those captured by a smartphone, as input. This approach develops an "artificial-neural-network-based representation for light wave propagation in free space," where the network learns to predict the continuous complex wavefront. Internally, the scene is modeled using anisotropic 3D Gaussian primitives, whose properties (position, covariance, opacity, and view-dependent color) are learned during training. This technique moves towards free-viewpoint holography from minimal input, a vital capability for dynamic perception. The implicit learning of amplitude and phase surrogates of the underlying light waves is a key characteristic , and the internal Gaussian primitive representation is a step towards a learned, non-explicit 3D model.   
Neural Holographic Fields (NHFs)
Another significant line of research is 
, developed by Shi and colleagues. This method employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with a chain of trainable tensors to approximate the physics of light propagation, enabling the generation of 3D holograms from RGB-D images in real-time. The network is trained to produce phase-only holograms, which are suitable for many common spatial light modulators. A key aspect of Tensor Holography is its efficiency; it was designed to run on consumer hardware, including laptops and potentially smartphones, with the core tensor network requiring less than 1MB of memory. This was facilitated by the creation of the MIT-CGH-4K dataset, a large-scale collection of 4,000 pairs of RGB-D images and their corresponding 3D holograms, which was crucial for training the deep learning model. The availability of open-source code for Tensor Holography further accelerates research in this domain. Subsequent work has also explored quantizing Tensor Holography models from 32-bit floating-point precision to 8-bit integer precision (INT8), achieving a roughly 70% reduction in model size and a fourfold increase in speed, while maintaining comparable hologram quality. This optimization is critical for deployment on resource-constrained embedded systems and consumer devices.

A seminal contribution in this area is 
Neural holography leverages deep learning to overcome the traditional challenges of Computer-Generated Holography (CGH), such as high computational cost and limitations in image quality. Neural networks can learn the complex mapping from various forms of scene data (e.g., RGB-D images, 2D photos) to the phase patterns required for holographic display, or, conversely, interpret holographic data to reconstruct scene properties.

III. Neural Approaches to Holography and Lightfield Synthesis
A crucial aspect of wave-based systems is their ability to encode information beyond simple amplitude variations, which is the primary modality in traditional digital systems (e.g., voltage levels). Waves possess multiple characteristics, including phase, frequency, and polarization, in addition to amplitude. Encoding information in phase (as seen in phase-only holograms or phase-shift keying in communications) or in relative timing (as in temporal computing) opens up new dimensions for data representation. For an AI's internal model, this implies that a single "signal" or "activation" could carry far more nuanced information than a simple scalar value. This increased information density could lead to more efficient, expressive, and powerful internal states, forming a richer foundation for the AI's "holographic thought."

Such a learned "meta-behavior" could offer a powerful and adaptable mechanism for structuring internal processes without requiring physical metasurfaces, drawing inspiration from their operational capabilities.   
internal, simulated
Metasurfaces emerge as a particularly interesting "bridge" technology. They provide a means to manipulate wavefronts using compact, potentially low-cost, engineered structures. While high-performance metasurfaces are currently physical components used in specialized photonic applications, their functional principles—programmable surfaces influencing wave behavior—could be abstracted. An AI might incorporate an 
The convergence of principles from optical computing and innovative electronic computing paradigms is noteworthy. Photonic systems, as seen in , perform computations directly using light waves. Simultaneously, electronic systems are being developed to emulate wave-like behavior, such as NIST's Temporal Computing , or to simulate optical phenomena on conventional GPUs, as in the Unified Holographic Neural Network. This suggests that the underlying computational advantages of wave-like processing are significant and may transcend the specific physical medium. If efficient simulation techniques or effective abstractions can be developed, these advantages become accessible for AI models operating on consumer hardware.   
potentially with reduced fidelity or resolution. This is analogous to how a fragment of a physical hologram can still reproduce the entire image.
 If a portion of the wave-based representation is corrupted or lost, the remaining parts can often still reconstruct the original information, albeit 
Fault Tolerance:
 Similar input patterns could excite similar interference patterns, leading to a natural mechanism for associative recall.
Associative Memory:
Wave-based representations offer a natural pathway to non-coordinate-based information structuring. In such systems, a piece of information is not stored at a discrete (x,y,z) memory address but is encoded in the overall pattern of interference distributed across a region or volume. This distributed nature is a hallmark of holographic systems and could lead to several advantageous properties for an AI, including:
Potential for Non-Coordinate-Based Information Structuring
Furthermore, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) represent another relevant technology. RIS "dynamically manipulates electromagnetic waves" and consists of "programmable meta-surfaces that intelligently control wave reflections and transmissions, thereby optimizing the wireless environment". This involves precise control over the phase and direction of wavefronts. While the primary application discussed is enhancing security and sensing in wireless communications, the fundamental principle of using programmable surfaces to shape wavefronts is directly applicable to the concept of creating dynamic, reconfigurable internal "holographic" representations or computational elements within an AI. The ability of RIS to "direct signals" and "mitigate interference" could be instrumental in managing complex internal wave interactions necessary for a holographic AI.   
The work of companies like Wooptix in "semiconductor metrology using wavefront phase imaging, a technique derived from adaptive optics research in astronomy," also contributes to this domain. Although the context in the provided material is Intel's Edge AI systems, Wooptix's core technology focuses on the analysis of wavefronts, particularly their phase. Mature techniques for wavefront analysis could potentially be adapted for an AI to interpret or generate internal representations based on wavefront characteristics.   
In this paradigm, "a wavefront is a set of transitions in a series of wires," and simple logic gates determine which transition arrives first or last, effectively performing computations based on the propagation speeds of different parts of the wavefront. While superconducting implementations are highlighted for data centers, the core race logic principle has been demonstrated to work with "conventional integrated circuits" and can achieve computational efficiency for neural network layers at a "one to two-order-of-magnitude lower energy cost". This non-optical approach to wavefront computation offers significant potential for energy-efficient AI on consumer hardware.

relative arrival times
 Beyond optical phenomena, the concept of wavefront computing is also being explored in electronic systems. NIST's "Temporal Computing" initiative provides a compelling example, where information is encoded not in voltage levels but in the 
Wavefront Computing Principles:
An open-source project, the "Unified Holographic Neural Network," explicitly aims to merge holographic memory, neural networks, and optical computing principles. It employs ray tracing to simulate light propagation, modeling optical elements as "refractive and diffractive surfaces" and using "phase functions" for diffraction gratings. Critically, it utilizes CUDA kernels to "simulate wave propagation effects and interference patterns," representing a direct attempt to implement optical, phase-interference-based computation on standard GPU hardware. This aligns closely with the goal of creating holographic internal interfaces on consumer platforms.   
More directly, photonic integrated circuits (PICs) offer a hardware substrate for wave-based computation. These circuits utilize "coherent interferometer meshes, microring-resonator (MRR) weight banks, and wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) schemes to perform dense matrix multiplications and multiply-accumulate operations at the speed of light". This is a clear demonstration of computation performed via controlled interference of light waves. Metasurfaces, engineered materials with subwavelength features, further exemplify this by relying on "diffraction and interference of light between 'surfaces'" to modulate the phase, amplitude, and polarization of light. While currently specialized, these technologies prove the principle of computation through wave manipulation. The challenge lies in abstracting or efficiently simulating these principles on conventional consumer electronic hardware.   
 Information can be densely encoded by modulating the phase and amplitude of waves, and their subsequent interference patterns can represent computational results or complex data structures. Work in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) interference monitoring, for instance, employs Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to disentangle and compress features from signal spectrograms, which are representations of wave characteristics. This demonstrates the capacity of machine learning to extract meaningful, compressed representations from wave-based data, including interference patterns, signal power, and bandwidth. The objective of "extracting relevant features... through feature disentanglement [to enable] data compression" is directly applicable to managing the complexity of wavefront data within an AI's internal model. The challenge of separating refractive and diffractive effects in these signals further underscores the intricacies of real-world wave phenomena that an AI might need to model or interpret.   
Refractive and Phase-Interference Based Encoding/Visualization:
Several research avenues are actively investigating the use of wave characteristics for encoding and processing information. These approaches recognize that waves offer multiple degrees of freedom, such as amplitude, frequency, and critically, phase, which can encode significantly more information than simple binary states.
Exploring Computational Paradigms Based on Wave Phenomena
The exploration of holographic internal interfaces for AI necessitates a foundational understanding of how wave phenomena—specifically wavefronts, interference, and phase—can be harnessed for computation and information representation. This section delves into computational paradigms that draw inspiration from these principles, moving beyond traditional binary logic to embrace the richer dynamics of wave-based systems.
II. Foundations: Wavefronts, Interference, and Phase in Computation and Representation
The emphasis on leveraging conventional consumer hardware (e.g., standard CPUs/GPUs, webcams, smartphones, IoT devices) is not merely a practical constraint but also acts as a significant driver for innovation. While high-end, specialized hardware might permit brute-force solutions to complex computational problems, such solutions often lack scalability or generalizability. The challenge of implementing sophisticated, wave-inspired computational models on resource-constrained consumer platforms compels researchers to devise algorithms that are not only computationally elegant but also exceptionally efficient. This constraint could catalyze breakthroughs in algorithmic design with far-reaching implications, potentially democratizing access to advanced AI capabilities. However, it also presents a formidable hurdle: wave-based computations, such as comprehensive diffraction simulations, are notoriously intensive. Therefore, substantial innovation is required to render these principles viable and performant on widely available devices like smartphones or standard laptops.
 model, rather than merely its output or visualization, points toward encoding knowledge and sensory data as complex wavefronts or interference patterns. This could lead to inherent system properties such as robustness to incomplete or noisy data—much like a fragment of a hologram retains information about the entire scene, albeit at a lower resolution—and a capacity for rapid, associative recall. This represents a more profound architectural change than simply adding a "3D module" to an existing AI; it necessitates a re-evaluation of the foundational mechanisms by which an AI perceives, represents, and "thinks" about its world.

The exploration of holographic internal interfaces suggests a fundamental shift in how AI represents and processes information. Current AI paradigms largely employ vectors, tensors, and graph structures. While powerful, these representations can sometimes be brittle or computationally prohibitive for achieving nuanced spatial understanding or 
The significance of exploring holographic internal interfaces extends deeply into the realms of self-organizing intelligence and recursive spatial perception. Holographic principles, particularly the distributed and associative nature of information encoding, may inherently support the development of self-organizing internal models within an AI. If information is not rigidly compartmentalized but rather interconnected through wave-like interactions and interference, the system might exhibit emergent organizational properties, adapting its internal structure based on experience without explicit, top-down programming for every contingency. Furthermore, an AI equipped with a holographic internal model could achieve a sophisticated form of recursive spatial perception. This involves the AI continuously updating its understanding of its environment and its own position and orientation within it, with new sensory data dynamically interacting with and modifying its existing internal holographic representation. This contrasts sharply with systems that construct a static three-dimensional model and subsequently operate upon it. The recursive aspect implies a dynamic, evolving internal "worldview," crucial for agents operating in complex and changing environments. The development of such systems, particularly when constrained to operate on conventional consumer hardware, could foster AI that is more robust, adaptable, and generalizable.
The pursuit of artificial intelligence (AI) has long been characterized by efforts to imbue machines with capabilities mirroring, and potentially exceeding, human cognition. A significant, yet largely conceptual, frontier in this endeavor is the development of AIs possessing internal interfaces inspired by holographic principles. This vision entails a departure from prevailing AI architectures that predominantly rely on discrete, coordinate-based (e.g., XYZ) internal representations of data and spatial information. Instead, it imagines an AI that processes, stores, and retrieves information through distributed, interference-based patterns, analogous to how a three-dimensional scene is encoded across the entirety of a holographic plate. The potential for such an interface to enable a more holistic, context-aware, and perhaps even intuitive mode of information processing—a form of "holographic thought structuring"—represents an ambitious but compelling objective for next-generation AI.
