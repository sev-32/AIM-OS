Appendices & Back Matter
Chapter 1 — The Why
1.1 The Machine-Communication Thesis (Beyond “chat”)
Thesis
Large models are not “chatbots.” They are machine-communication engines: mediators that translate among people, documents, tools, files, networks, and code—while remembering, orchestrating, witnessing, and evolving in verifiable ways.
AIMOS/APOE turns this thesis into an operating system:
CMC (Context Memory Core): converts ephemeral context into structured, queryable, reversible memory.
APOE (Prompt Orchestration Engine): compiles reasoning into typed plans, not one-shot guesses.
VIF (Verifiable Intelligence Fabric): every claim ships with lineage, uncertainty, and replayability.
SDF-CVF (Atomic Evolution): code, docs, tags, and traces evolve as one through gates.
SEG (Shared Evidence Graph): evidence is a graph, time-sliced and exportable.
Together, these make “chat” merely the UI skin over a disciplined, auditable machine-to-machine protocol.
Why “chat” fails at scale
Ephemerality. Conversation context evaporates; decisions cannot be reproduced.
Improvisation. One-shot prompting has no budgets, no roles, no contracts.
Opacity. Outputs lack provenance, uncertainty, or replays; trust is performative.
Drift. Code/spec/tests/provenance diverge; fixes are tribal knowledge.
Silolization. Documents, tools, and time live in separate islands; no cohesive lineage.
Conclusion: “Better prompts” cannot fix structural defects. Architecture must.
What “machine communication” requires
1) Memory-native IO.
All IO (prompts, files, API calls, logs) lands first as atoms in CMC → indices (HHNI) → snapshots → graph entries in SEG.
2) Compiled reasoning.
Tasks are plans (DAGs) with roles, tools, and explicit budgets. Plans run deterministically (or abstain).
3) Verifiable speech.
Every artifact carries VIF: model id, weights hash, prompt template id, tool calls, snapshot id, and UQ (calibrated confidence).
4) Atomic evolution.
A single commit spans code/docs/tags/traces, gated by tests/spec/provenance/HITL. Quarantine on failure; rollback is cheap.
5) Graph substrate.
Claims, sources, tools, decisions live as typed nodes/edges with temporal validity; contradictions are first-class, not deletions.
Minimal surface: the five invariants as protocol layers
Link layer: CMC — atoms, indices, snapshots (write once, cite forever).
Network layer: APOE — typed plans, budgets, routes, parallelization.
Transport layer: VIF — provenance packets and UQ headers at each hop.
Session layer: SDF-CVF — parity gates across artifacts; HITL checkpoints.
Application layer: SEG — time-sliced evidence queries and exports.
Design consequences (non-negotiable)
Snapshot-first IO. Nothing user-visible exists without a snapshot id.
Two-stage reads. Coarse → fine retrieval, with dumbbell compression to avoid “lost in the middle.”
Budgets at boundaries. Each step declares tokens/time/tools; breaches abort or route to HITL.
Witness or abstain. If RS < κ or calibration poor, the system must decline or escalate.
Atomic parity. No doc/spec change merges without corresponding tests/code/provenance passing gates.
Temporal truth. SEG queries are as-of time; deprecations leave tombstones and contradiction edges.
Core mechanics (concise)
Retrieval score: RS = norm(QS · IDS · (1 − DD)) 
∈
 [0,1]
QS content quality, IDS indexing depth, DD dependency delta.
Abstention threshold: κ (decline when RS < κ or UQ > κ).
DVNS refinement: post-KNN force-guided pathing (gravity/elastic/repulse/damping) to improve Top-k precision under policy constraints.
Worked mini-scenarios
A) Protocol translation (machine↔machine).
Input: “Convert this vendor XML feed into our JSON schema, validate, and post to /ingest.”
Flow: Ingest → CMC atoms/snapshot → APOE plan (mapping, validation, post) → VIF at each step → SEG lineage.
Result: Auditable transform with replayable witnesses and contract-level budgets.
B) File diplomacy (device↔file↔policy).
Input: “Summarize this 3GB log, redact PII, and propose remediations.”
Flow: Chunk→index (HHNI) → DVNS selects salient spans → redact per policy → APOE proposes fixes → κ/HITL on high risk → SEG anchors.
Result: Redaction proof + remediation plan, both replayable.
C) IDE-in-the-loop build (user↔code).
Input: “Scaffold a browser app, OAuth2 login, audit log export.”
Flow: Blueprint→APOE (scaffold, codegen, tests) → SDF-CVF gates → preview env → SEG export pack.
Result: Running app whose spec↔code↔tests↔traces are in parity.
KPIs (what improves when you leave “chat” behind)
Memory: p@k@latency↑, RS-lift vs. static KNN, snapshot-replay fidelity.
Orchestration: % deterministic plan replays at fixed seeds; budget adherence.
Trust: lineage completeness %, ECE (calibration) bands, κ true-positive abstentions.
Evolution: change-failure rate↓, MTTR↓, spec↔code parity score↑.
Compliance: export time (mins), redaction coverage %, contradiction capture rate.
Anti-goals (what we refuse to do)
Hallucinated citations or unverifiable claims.
Hidden tool usage or mutable, unlogged state.
“One-shot miracles” without plans, budgets, or witnesses.
Silent drift between docs, code, tests, and traces.
Risks & mitigations
Prompt injection / exfiltration: tool sandboxes, capability tokens, redaction by default, policy-aware DVNS.
Overconfidence: mandatory UQ, κ-abstention, calibration dashboards.
Plan bloat: ACL static checks, budget caps, chain health metrics (κ_chain).
Governance fatigue: HITL two-key only on R2/R3 risk tiers; everything else auto-merges under gates.
One-paragraph summary
Machine communication replaces “chat” with a memory-native, plan-driven, witness-first discipline. AIMOS/APOE operationalizes this with CMC (remember), APOE (compile), VIF (prove), SDF-CVF (evolve atomically), and SEG (graph the evidence). The result is a system that can translate, build, and decide—and show its work every step of the way.
1.2 From Context to Memory (CMC)
Problem
Raw prompts are ephemeral. Without structure, yesterday’s hard-won insight can’t be found, reused, audited, or reversed. “Chat logs” are not memory; they’re sediment.
Principle (Memory Invariant)
An intelligent system must convert ephemeral context into structured, queryable, and reversible memory.
CMC makes this operational by turning every input/output/tool call into atoms → indices → snapshots → evidence—the four layers of a memory-native stack.
A. The Four Layers
Atoms (what exists)
Minimal, typed facts created on ingest:
id, ts, author, modality{text|code|event|tool}, payload, aux{tags, spans, pii_mask}
embedding (vector), tpv (Tag Priority Vector: priority, relevance, decay)
Indices (how it’s found) — 
HHNI
Fractal, recursive indices from System → Section → Paragraph → Sentence → Word → Sub-word, with:
dependency edges (parent/child, supports, contradicts, relates_to)
IDS (Indexing Depth Score) and impact previews for safe edits
Snapshots (how it is frozen)
Content-addressed, immutable bundles of {atoms + indices + metadata}.
Signed digest, redaction map, policy labels
Reversibility: restore(snapshot_id) → (atoms, indices)
Evidence (how it is trusted) — 
SEG
JSON-LD graph nodes for claims/sources/tools/decisions with temporal validity.
Lineage: (model, weights_hash, prompt_template_id, tool_calls, snapshot_id)
Contradictions are edges, not deletions.
B. Write Path (Context → Memory)
Pipeline: ingest → atomize → enrich → index → score → gate → snapshot → graph
Ingest & Atomize. Normalize IO (prompt, file, API, log) into typed atoms.
Enrich. Summaries, tags, PII masking, embeddings; compute QS (quality).
Index. Insert into HHNI; compute IDS (depth/coverage).
Score. Compute DD (dependency delta) if editing linked content.
Gate (CMC-G). Require thresholds: QS≥θ_q, IDS≥θ_i, DD≤θ_d.
Snapshot-first. Produce snapshot_id; nothing surfaces without it.
Graph. Emit VIF lineage into SEG (with time slice [t_from, t_to)).
Retrieval Score (used later by readers):
C. Read Path (Memory → Context)
Two-stage read with “dumbbell compression”:
Coarse select. Vector KNN on embeddings + HHNI filters (scope, time, policy) → candidate packs.
Refine.
Dumbbell: keep early and late critical spans, compress the middle (prevents “lost-in-the-middle”).
DVNS (optional): physics-guided reranking (gravity/elastic/repulse/damping) under policy constraints.
Rehydrate. Expand final spans back to atoms; attach provenance, masks, and snapshot_id.
If RS < κ or UQ is poor → abstain or route to HITL.
D. Data Contracts (concise)
Atom (core)
Atom {
  id, ts, author, modality, payload, summary,
  tags[], embedding[], tpv{priority, relevance, decay},
  pii_mask, parent_molecule_id?
}
Index Edge
Edge {
  src_id, dst_id, type{contains|supports|contradicts|relates_to},
  weight, dependency_hash, impact_preview[]
}
Snapshot
Snapshot {
  id, digest, redactions[], policy_labels[], atom_refs[], index_refs[],
  created_by, created_at
}
SEG Node (claim/tool/decision)
VIF {
  artifact_id, model, weights_hash, prompt_template_id,
  tool_calls[], snapshot_id, uq{entropy, ece, band}, valid_from,to?
}
E. Guarantees
Reversibility. restore(snapshot) → (atoms, indices); diffs are explicit.
Monotonicity. Graph grows with time; deprecations leave tombstones/contradictions.
Determinism (under fixed state). Given (M_t, tools, seeds) the same read returns the same pack (within tolerance) or abstains.
Privacy by design. PII masked at ingest; redaction maps carried in snapshots; policy labels enforced at read.
F. Anti-Patterns (what CMC prevents)
Blob memory. Unstructured chat logs; impossible lineage.
Append-only amnesia. No indices, no decay, no retrieval control.
Mutable facts. Silent edits without snapshots; untraceable changes.
Monolithic context. Huge prompts with LIM; no dumbbell or HHNI.
G. Minimal Pseudocode
def write_context(io):
    atoms = atomize(io)                         # modality-aware
    enrich(atoms)                               # summary, tags, embeddings, QS
    idx = index_hhni(atoms)                     # IDS, edges, hashes
    dd  = dependency_delta(idx)                 # impact of edits
    if not gate(qs=atoms.QS, ids=idx.IDS, dd=dd): raise GateReject
    snap = snapshot(atoms, idx)                 # content-addressed
    emit_vif(snapshot=snap, io=io)              # SEG lineage
    return snap.id
def read_memory(query, t=None, policy=None):
    cands = knn(query.embedding, scope=(t, policy))
    refined = dumbbell_compress(cands)
    packed = dvns_refine(refined, policy=policy)  # optional
    if packed.RS < kappa or packed.UQ.bad: return Abstain
    return rehydrate(packed)  # atoms + provenance + snapshot_id
H. KPIs (for CMC)
p@k@latency on retrieval; RS-lift vs. static KNN
Snapshot replay fidelity (exact/functional)
Lineage completeness % (atoms with VIF)
Edit safety: mean DD, count of blocked high-impact edits
Privacy coverage: PII mask hit-rate, redaction drift
I. Example (before/after)
Before (chat):
“Summarize the 3GB logs and suggest fixes.” → One-off answer; no sources; can’t reproduce.
After (CMC):
Logs atomized; masked; embedded.
HHNI links errors↔deploy events; snapshot_id=S-8421.
DVNS elevates salient spans; APOE proposes remediations.
Output cites S-8421, tool calls, model hash, and UQ band.
A week later, replay(S-8421) reproduces the same pack for audit.
J. Design Constraints (binding)
C-1 Single writer. All writes via CreateMemory transactional flow.
C-2 Snapshot-first. Nothing surfaces without a snapshot_id.
C-3 Two-stage read. Coarse→refine with dumbbell; DVNS optional.
C-4 Policy-aware. PII masks & labels must propagate into every read pack.
C-5 Witness-ready. Every read result carries VIF suitable for SEG insertion.
1.3 From Improvisation to Compilation (APOE)
Problem
Single-shot prompting improvises reasoning. It drifts with phrasing, is hard to reproduce, and hides cost/risk. Complex work (research, coding, operations) needs plans, not vibes.
Principle (Orchestration Invariant)
Reasoning must be compiled, not improvised.
APOE (AIMOS Prompt Orchestration Engine) turns intent into a typed, budgeted, auditable plan; executes it; and emits a witnessed trace you can replay.
A. What APOE Is
Plan 
is a finite DAG over steps 
, edges 
define data/control flow.
Step signature
Inputs: atoms/read-packs from CMC, constants, prior step outputs.
Tools: LLM calls, RAG queries, code runners, HTTP, sandboxed shells.
Budgets: 
.
Artifacts: text/code/config/test/results.
Witness: VIF provenance + UQ vector (entropy/calibration) + snapshot ids.
Roles 
(typed executors)
: planner, retriever, reasoner, builder, verifier, critic, operator, witness.
Determinism under fixed state: With fixed 
(memory), tools, seeds, and budgets, 
yields the same trace (or abstains at 
).
B. Compile-Time vs Run-Time
Compile-time (before any LLM call):
Intent parse → task graph. Decompose goals; annotate edges with data/decision dependencies.
Budgeting. Allocate token/time/cost envelopes per step; define global caps.
Static checks. Type/effect checks (e.g., “tool:db.write” forbidden in read-only plan), PII policy, cyclicity.
Acceptance criteria. Per step success predicates & gates (tests, RS thresholds, UQ bands).
Emission of ACL. Plan lowered into ACL (AIMOS Chain Language) for execution.
Run-time (when executing):
Routing & parallelization. Topologically schedule; run independent branches in parallel; cache stable subplans.
Boundary gates. Each step emits VIF+UQ; if 
band or RS<
 → repair, fallback, or abstain.
Self-rewrite via evidence. If a gate fails with actionable evidence, planner may edit the plan, bump version, and continue (bounded by rewrite budget).
Witness trace. All inputs/outputs/tool calls/snapshots recorded to SEG.
C. Minimal Formalism
Typed step:
: set of atoms/read-packs; 
: new/modified artifacts; 
: witness node(s).
Gate 
accepts 
iff all predicates hold: tests, RS, policy, UQ.
Abstention 
: if 
(from calibrated UQ), the step returns ABSTAIN.
Objective (multi-criteria)
Minimize 
subject to: All gates pass; global risk 
; budgets respected.
D. APOE Lifecycle (concise)
Plan Synthesis.
Input: user goal + context sketch → plan draft with roles, tools, budgets, gates.
Compilation (ACL).
Lower draft into ACL with types, effects, and static guarantees.
Execution.
Orchestrator runs steps; retrieval uses CMC (RS-aware); reasoning uses LLM; verification runs tests/critics.
Witnessing.
For each boundary: record model id, weights hash, prompt template id, tool calls, snapshot ids, UQ.
Adaptation.
If evidence suggests a better route, perform bounded DEPP self-rewrite (new ACL version, linked in SEG).
Closeout.
Emit artifacts + replayable trace; update CMC; surface KPIs.
E. Anti-Patterns APOE Eliminates
One-shot megaprompting. No budgets, no gates, brittle outcomes.
Hidden tool use. No lineage or policy check; exfiltration risk.
Heuristic retries. “Try again” loops without calibrated UQ or acceptance tests.
Spec/code drift. Output without parity gates or atomic commits.
F. Constraints (binding)
O-1 Budgets explicit. Tokens/time/tools/cost must be declared per step and enforced.
O-2 Typed roles. Steps must declare role and permitted effects (read, write, network, exec).
O-3 Boundary gates. Every step ends with verifiable gates (tests/RS/UQ/policy) and emits VIF.
G. Tiny Example (research→draft→critique)
ACL sketch
pipeline ResearchNote(goal)
  step plan as planner
    inputs  = {goal}
    budgets = {tokens:4k, time:30s}
    out     = outline
    gate    = {nonempty(outline)}
  step retrieve as retriever
    inputs  = {outline}
    tools   = {rag.search}
    budgets = {tokens:3k}
    out     = sources[]
    gate    = {p_at_5(sources) >= 0.8, policy.ok(sources)}
  step draft as reasoner
    inputs  = {outline, sources}
    tools   = {llm.write}
    budgets = {tokens:6k}
    out     = note.md
    gate    = {UQ.band in [A,B], cites(sources)}
  step critique as critic
    inputs  = {note.md}
    tools   = {llm.review}
    out     = issues[]
    gate    = {len(critical(issues)) == 0}
  witness all
end
Execution result: note.md + SEG lineage; replay uses the same snapshots & seeds.
H. Pseudocode (orchestrator core)
def run(plan):
    state = {}
    for s in topo_sort(plan):
        x = collect_inputs(s, state, CMC)
        y, w = execute(s, x)               # tools bounded by budgets
        if not gate_pass(s, y, w):
            decision = repair_or_abstain(s, x, y, w)
            if decision == "repair": plan = bounded_rewrite(plan, s, evidence=w)
            else: return ABSTAIN, witness_so_far()
        state.update(y); record_vif(s, w)
    return state, full_witness()
I. KPIs (for APOE)
Determinism rate (trace match under replay).
Gate pass-through (per role) and true-positive abstentions at 
.
Budget adherence (tokens/time/cost), cost per accepted artifact.
Repair efficacy (first-repair success), rewrite frequency.
Lineage completeness (VIF coverage).
J. Why It Matters
APOE converts “ask the model” into compile-and-run a program over memory, tools, and policies. The result is crisper answers, lower variance, transparent cost, and replayable trust—the necessary substrate for safe, large-scale machine communication.
1.4 From Claims to Witness (VIF)
Problem
Outputs that look right but can’t show how they were made are un-auditable risks. In regulated or high-stakes workflows, an answer without lineage is indistinguishable from a rumor.
Principle (Witness Invariant)
A claim that cannot show its lineage is a rumor.
VIF (Verifiable Intelligence Framework) makes every artifact provable, replayable, and calibrated. It standardizes 
what
 must be recorded at each boundary and 
how
 it is queried, displayed, and audited.
A. What VIF Guarantees
Lineage: A machine-readable path from claim → evidence → sources/tools → snapshot.
Provenance integrity: Immutable IDs (content hashes), signed envelopes, versioned prompts/tools.
Uncertainty disclosure: Calibrated UQ vectors; abstention if risk ≥ κ.
Replayability: The ability to re-execute the exact trace on the exact data/model versions.
Exportability: Self-contained evidence packs (for audit/compliance).
B. Minimal Formalism
Let 
be the Shared Evidence Graph (SEG) at time 
.
A claim node 
is valid iff there exists a path:
with a provenance tuple 
and uncertainty vector 
:
Calibration: expected calibration error 
over held-out checkpoints; otherwise claims in that band require HITL.
Replayability: There exists a function 
such that:
C. VIF Envelope (at every step boundary)
Each boundary (APOE step) must emit a VIF envelope:
{
  "witness_id": "w_01F8MECHZX3TBDSZ7XRADM79XE",
  "time": "2025-10-17T19:21:54Z",
  "actor": { "role": "reasoner", "principal": "apoe@system" },
  "claim": {
    "id": "claim:summary:v3",
    "type": "text/markdown",

    "parents": ["claim:outline:v2"]
  },
  "context": {

    "entropy": 1.27,
    "ensemble_spread": 0.11,
    "calibration_bucket": "B",
    "ece_at_bucket": 0.024,
    "kappa_decision": "ACCEPT"  // or ABSTAIN/ESCALATE
  },
  "citations": [
    { "source_id": "doc:ISO27001:2022", "span": "L210-L245", "hash": "sha256-…" },
    { "source_id": "kb:design:authz-v2", "section": "3.1", "hash": "sha256-…" }
  ],
  "signatures": {
    "witness_sig": "ed25519:…",
    "chain_root": "merkle:…"
  }
}
Notes
All large payloads are content-addressed; the envelope stores hashes + IDs, not blobs.
Prompt template and weights are versioned and hashed.
Citations point into the SEG with byte/line spans (or structured selectors).
D. Operational Rules (binding)
V-1 No envelope, no artifact. If a step fails to produce a valid VIF, its artifact is non-exportable and cannot advance the chain.
V-2 Show uncertainty by default. UI must render confidence bands; low-calibration buckets are yellow/red-flagged.
V-3 Replay or retract. Any contested claim must be replayed from its snapshot; if replay fails, mark claim RETRACTED and create a contradiction edge.
V-4 Tamper-evidence. Envelopes are signed (ed25519) and rooted in a Merkle tree committed to the snapshot log.
V-5 Synthetic labeling. All AI-generated content carries machine-readable labels (content authenticity metadata).
E. UQ Methods (practical menu)
Temperature sweep (T=0.2…1.0) with agreement rate → spread.
Dropout/seed ensembles → variance proxy.
Retrieval overlap (top-k overlap across reruns) → grounding confidence.
Calibrators: Platt/Isotonic on task-specific dev sets → ECE.
Hybrid risk score 
.
κ-gating: If 
or ECE > ε for the bucket, ABSTAIN or ESCALATE (HITL).
F. UI/UX for Trust
Inline confidence chip (“Conf: B • ±11%”) with hover to expand how it was computed.
One-click lineage panel: sources, tool calls, prompt template, model hash, snapshot id.
Replay button (guarded): re-execute with frozen inputs; diff overlay of outputs.
Citations as anchors: clicking a citation jumps to the SEG node/selector.
Risk banners: red/yellow bands for out-of-calibration buckets; direct “Send to reviewer.”
G. Failure Modes & Mitigations
Failure
Symptom
Guard
Orphan claims
Artifact with no envelope
V-1 hard fail; quarantine branch
Prompt drift
Same template id, different text
Hash prompts; diff at gate
Tool-call blind spots
Hidden HTTP/FS access
Capability tokens; tool registry; log all side-effects
Calibration rot
Confidently wrong answers
Continuous ECE monitoring; recalibrate or raise κ
Provenance forgery
Edited envelopes
Sign & Merkle-root; verify on read/export
H. KPIs (VIF)
Lineage coverage (% artifacts with valid VIF).
Replay fidelity (% deterministic replays within tolerance).
Calibration health (ECE by bucket; drift alarms).
Abstention quality (precision/recall of κ decisions).
Export pass rate (evidence packs that validate end-to-end).
I. Micro-Example (research paragraph)
Claim: “AES-256-GCM provides confidentiality and integrity with 128-bit tags.”
VIF: cites NIST SP 800-38D (spans), model/weights/prompt hashes, UQ band B, κ=ACCEPT.
Replay: re-run retrieval + summarization from same snapshot; identical citation set; textual diff = 0.
J. How VIF Fits the Whole
With CMC/HHNI: VIF envelopes bind claims to atoms & indices at the moment of use.
With APOE: every boundary emits a witness; gates consume UQ to accept/abstain.
With SEG: VIFs are edges & nodes in the evidence graph; time-sliced queries return who-knew-what-when.
With SDF-CVF: releases are witnessed decisions; if later contradicted, we amend—we don’t silently overwrite.
Bottom line: VIF turns answers into evidence—measurable, explainable, and safe to build upon.
1.5 From Drift to Atomic Evolution (SDF-CVF)
Problem
Software and knowledge systems rot when their artifacts evolve out of sync. A model fixes a bug in code but not in docs; a policy tag changes but logs don’t record the new constraint; a test is updated but the incident runbook isn’t. This artifact drift creates invisible failure surfaces that no prompt can paper over.
Principle (Atomic Evolution Invariant)
Code, docs, tags, and traces must evolve as one.
(
SDF-CVF
 names the quartet we bind together: Source/Docs/Facts ↔ Code/Verification/Forensics.)
We treat every change as an atomic, witnessed bundle that preserves parity across the quartet and is either accepted as a whole or quarantined as a whole.
A. Artifact Quartet & Parity
Artifacts (minimal):
Code: source, configs, schemas, migrations.
Docs: specs, ADRs, runbooks, user help, API docs.
Tags: policies, data classifications, PII labels, license headers, ACLs.
Traces: tests, telemetry contracts, evidence links (VIF), SEG lineage, incident notes.
Parity means: for any semantic change in one member, the impacted members reflect that change 
in the same commit
 and the system can prove it.
B. Formalization
Let 
be a proposed change-set. Define typed diffs:
Each commit produces gate outcomes:
A parity score 
aggregates sub-parities:
where each 
is a normalized semantic-diff alignment (1.0 = perfectly synchronized).
Acceptance rule.
Else QUARANTINE with an auto-fix plan or ROLLBACK to last green snapshot.
Reproducibility. Every accepted change is anchored by a snapshot id and a witness envelope (VIF) that ties diffs to models, prompts, tools, and tests used.
C. Gate Catalog (binding, extendable)
Gate
What it checks
Minimal signals
g_tests
Functional/contract correctness
Unit/integration/e2e; golden IO; schema/ABI stability
g_spec
Doc/spec ↔ code parity
Spec-to-code trace links; unresolved TODOs = FAIL
g_tags
Policy/labels correctness
PII/PD/License tags; breaking policy deltas escalate
g_trace
Evidence & observability
VIF completeness; SEG lineage; telemetry contracts
g_risk
Risk & HITL
κ decision from UQ; risk score ≥ τ 
⇒
 HITL two-key
Non-bypassable: If a gate can’t run, it returns ABSTAIN and blocks the merge.
D. Atomic Bundle Pipeline (δ → decision)
Pipeline steps (synchronous):
Normalize: parse/AST docs & code; canonicalize tags; extract trace selectors.
Diff: compute typed diffs and impact graph (which files/paths must change).
Link: validate cross-refs (spec anchors, code symbols, policy targets, test names).
Prove: run tests; build VIF witnesses; update SEG working set.
Score: compute parity 
, UQ-risk, and budget deltas.
Decide: ACCEPT / QUARANTINE / ROLLBACK; emit snapshot & witness.
Quarantine loop (asynchronous):
Generate auto-fix plan (missing doc sections, tag migrations, test stubs).
Open a remediation branch with suggested diffs and a check-list.
If remediation exceeds SLA or raises risk, rollback to 
and attach contradiction edges in SEG (we amend, never silently overwrite).
E. Data Structures (minimal)
Atomic-Bundle Manifest (ABM)
{
  "bundle_id": "abm_01HV…",
  "parent_snapshot": "snap_01HU…",
  "diffs": {
    "code": {"files":[...], "ast_hash":"sha256-…"},
    "docs": {"anchors":[...], "spec_map":[...]},
    "tags": {"adds":[...], "removes":[...], "migrations":[...]},
    "traces": {"tests":[...], "vif_ids":[...], "seg_edges":[...]}
  },
  "parity": {
    "spec_code": 0.93,
    "tags_code": 0.88,
    "trace_code": 0.95,
    "P": 0.92, "theta": 0.9
  },
  "gates": {
    "tests":"PASS",
    "spec":"PASS",
    "tags":"PASS",
    "trace":"PASS",
    "risk":"PASS"
  },
  "decision": "ACCEPT",
  "snapshot_id": "snap_01HV…",
  "witness_id": "w_01HV…",
  "signatures": {"bundle_sig":"ed25519:…"}
}
F. Algorithms (sketches)
Spec↔Code parity (AST-aware):
Extract spec anchors (requirements IDs, invariants).
Map anchors to code symbols (types/functions) via static analysis & comments.
Require: each changed symbol resolves to ≥1 updated anchor; each changed anchor resolves to ≥1 changed symbol. Compute F1 as 
.
Tags↔Code parity:
For each changed policy/tag, find binding sites (schemas, routes, collectors).
Validate presence of enforcement & redaction; diff runbooks for incident steps.
Trace parity:
Ensure every changed public surface has updated contracts (OpenAPI/ABI), tests, and telemetry selectors; VIF covers all public claims.
G. UI/UX (reviewer ergonomics)
Quartet diff view (4 synchronized panes) with cross-highlighting.
Parity chip (“P 0.92 • PASS”) expandable to sub-parities and missing links.
Gate bar (5 lights) with drill-downs; any ABSTAIN is clickable to root cause.
Auto-fix suggestions (apply-patch buttons) + HITL two-key banner if risk ≥ τ.
One-click replay (frozen snapshot) and SEG lineage overlay.
H. Failure Modes & Mitigations
Mode
Symptom
Mitigation
Silent drift
Code changed, spec didn’t
Gate g_spec blocks; auto-generate spec diff stubs
Policy holes
Tags updated, no enforcement
Gate g_tags requires instrumented checks & runbook diffs
Ghost tests
Spec updated, tests unchanged
Trace parity fails; scaffold test stubs; block until green
Broken lineage
Artifact has no VIF
Gate g_trace blocks; auto-witness on retry
Risk blindness
Confident but miscalibrated changes
κ-gate g_risk → ABSTAIN/HITL; recalibrate UQ
I. KPIs (Atomic Evolution)
Parity median 
per merge, p95 ≥ θ.
Change-failure rate (CFR) < 10% (DORA).
MTTR for quarantines and rollbacks (target by tier).
Lineage coverage 100% (all bundles witnessed).
Spec/code lag (time from code change → spec/runbook change) ≈ 0 for accepted bundles.
J. Micro-Example
Change:
 add “Export evidence pack” API.
Code: new endpoint + signer.
Docs: API section + example pack schema.
Tags: “exportable:true”, “contains:provenance”, “PII:none”.
Traces: new contract tests; VIF replay for sample pack; SEG node types verified.
Result: 
, all gates PASS → ACCEPT, snapshot minted, Merkle root updated.
K. Interfaces to the Rest
CMC/HHNI: ABM is the write gateway; accepted bundles update atoms/indices and tombstone deprecated nodes.
APOE/ACL: plan steps include gate{…} constructs; failure auto-routes to remediation chains.
VIF/SEG: each bundle is a decision node linked to its claims, sources, and tools—time-sliced and exportable.
Security & Compliance: tags drive guardrails and retention; export packs satisfy audit pull-requests.
Bottom line: SDF-CVF converts “did we change the code?” into “did we evolve the system?”—and proves the answer, every time.
1.6 From Documents to Evidence Graphs (SEG)
Problem
Documents, tickets, chats, PRs, dashboards, and code reviews live in silos. They describe reality but rarely prove it. Over time, links break, screenshots rot, and “source of truth” collapses into trust-by-habit. Reasoning atop such strata is brittle and unauditable.
Principle (Substrate Invariant, SEG)
Evidence is a graph.
Every claim, source, derivation, tool-call, and decision is a typed node with signed, time-bounded edges. We query lineage, not folders.
A. What the SEG is (and isn’t)
Is: a temporal, typed, content-addressed knowledge graph that binds the four pillars:
Claims (propositions the system asserts),
Sources (documents, datasets, code, runs),
Derivations (transformations: prompts, tools, compilers, tests),
Decisions (approvals, releases, merges).
Is not: a general document store, wiki, or vector DB. Those are attached as sources; the SEG carries relationships and witness.
B. Core vocabulary (minimal types)
Claim: {id, text, scope, metrics, uncertainty}
Source: {id, uri|digest, modality, snapshot_id}
Derivation: {id, kind: ("LLMRun"|"Build"|"Test"|"Query"), inputs[], outputs[], tool, params, udf_hash}
Decision: {id, policy, approvers, outcome, rationale}
Witness: {id, model_id, weights_hash, prompt_id, tool_invocations[], timestamp, signature}
Edges (typed): supports, derivesFrom, contradicts, annotates, usesTool, witnessedBy
All nodes/edges carry validity intervals 
and content addresses (hashes) for immutability.
C. Temporal model & reversibility
Event-sourced: new facts append; we never silently mutate. Corrections add contradicts or supersedes edges.
Time-slicing: every query is evaluated “as of” a timestamp; the graph kernel masks edges whose 
excludes the slice.
Tombstones: deprecations are explicit nodes/edges, not deletes—preserving audit trails.
D. Minimal JSON-LD schema (sketch)
{
  "@context": {
    "id": "@id",
    "type": "@type",
    "Claim": "https://aimos.ai/seg#Claim",
    "Source": "https://aimos.ai/seg#Source",
    "Derivation": "https://aimos.ai/seg#Derivation",
    "Decision": "https://aimos.ai/seg#Decision",
    "Witness": "https://aimos.ai/seg#Witness",
    "supports": {"@id":"https://aimos.ai/seg#supports","@type":"@id"},
    "derivesFrom": {"@id":"https://aimos.ai/seg#derivesFrom","@type":"@id"},
    "contradicts": {"@id":"https://aimos.ai/seg#contradicts","@type":"@id"},
    "witnessedBy": {"@id":"https://aimos.ai/seg#witnessedBy","@type":"@id"},
    "validFrom": {"@id":"https://aimos.ai/seg#validFrom","@type":"xsd:dateTime"},
    "validTo": {"@id":"https://aimos.ai/seg#validTo","@type":"xsd:dateTime"}
  },
  "id": "urn:seg:claim:sha256:7a…",
  "type": "Claim",
  "text": "Export packs include VIF and UQ bands.",
  "supports": ["urn:seg:source:sha256:ab…", "urn:seg:deriv:sha256:cd…"],
  "witnessedBy": "urn:seg:witness:sha256:ef…",
  "validFrom": "2025-10-17T12:00:00Z"
}
Identifiers. Use urn:seg:<kind>:sha256:<digest> over canonicalized payloads.
Attachments. Large artifacts (docs, models, logs) remain in object stores; SEG stores content digests + URIs.
E. Write path (how facts enter)
Produce artifact → hash → store in object store (content-addressed).
Mint nodes: Source for the artifact; Derivation for the process that created it; Witness for VIF (model, weights hash, prompt id, tool list, signature).
Assert claims with supports/derivesFrom/witnessedBy edges.
Sign & time-bound nodes/edges; publish to SEG log.
Materialize index views (by time, by project, by policy tag).
All writes funnel through CreateEvidence (the “single writer” analog for SEG).
F. Read path (how we answer “why?”)
Canonical queries:
Lineage (backward): given a Claim 
, find all acyclic paths
within the time slice. Return the minimal hitting set of sources that cover the claim’s predicates.
Impact (forward): given a Source 
, enumerate Decisions reachable via
.
Contradiction detection: find pairs 
with a contradicts edge active in the slice; rank by affected Decisions.
Replay recipe: from a Decision, collect the frontier of Derivations + Witnesses; emit a frozen replay manifest.
Interfaces: SPARQL/Gremlin-style, plus a high-level “LineageQL”:
SELECT lineage FROM Claim('urn:…') AS OF '2025-10-17'
WHERE depth <= 3 AND include = {Witness, Derivation}
G. Quality & safety properties
Completeness (w.r.t plan): APOE plan execution must emit a Witness per step; empty or partial witnesses fail gates.
Non-repudiation: nodes/edges are signed; any replay verifies content digests and signatures.
Least disclosure: privacy-sensitive attributes are redacted-at-ingest with reversible redaction tokens stored under purpose-bound keys.
Abstention hooks: if lineage depth < τ or calibration error > κ, render claims with yellow bands and route to HITL.
H. Export packs (regulatory, read-only)
A SEG Export Pack is a zipped, signed bundle with:
Manifest: top-level Decision/Claim ids, time slice, policy scope.
Graph slice: JSON-LD nodes/edges reachable within constraints.
Artifacts: content-addressed pointers + signed digests (optionally inlined small files).
Replay: deterministic recipe (container images, model ids, prompts, seeds).
UQ & calibration report: κ/ECE bands, failure cases.
Redaction map: what was hidden, under which legal basis.
Packs are immutable; re-issuing creates a new pack with derivesFrom the prior.
I. UI/UX for comprehension
Subway-map lineage: Decision at right; sources at left; derivations in the middle; chips for Witness and UQ bands.
Time scrubber: slide along the timeline to watch edges appear/disappear.
Explain button: expands a minimal proof (fewest edges) for the selected claim.
Risk lenses: toggle to highlight un-witnessed nodes, low-confidence edges, or policy-tagged sources (PII, license).
J. Operational commitments (design constraints)
S-1 Time-slicing API: every read accepts asOf and returns only active edges.
S-2 Contradictions as first-class: we add contradicts edges; we do not delete history.
S-3 Export-ready: one-click packs with replay and UQ are mandatory for “High-Risk” scopes.
S-4 Content addressing: all artifacts referenced by digest; mutable URLs are advisory only.
S-5 Single writer: CreateEvidence is transactional; partial writes are rejected.
K. Micro-example (end-to-end)
Claim: “Release v1.8 complies with PII policy and meets p95 latency < 120 ms.”
Supports:
Source(OpenAPI spec@sha), Source(latency dashboard snapshot@sha), Source(DP policy doc@sha).
Derivation(LoadTest run@sha, tool=k6, params), Derivation(DP scanner report@sha).
Witness: model+weights hash + prompt template for the summarizer used to generate the release note.
Decision: “Approve release v1.8,” two-key approvers, rationale, outcome=APPROVED.
Edges: supports(Claim←Source/Derivation), witnessedBy(Claim←Witness), derivesFrom(Decision←Claim).
Time-slice: As of 2025-10-17T12:34Z, all edges valid; at 2025-10-18 a new Claim with contradicts appears when latency regresses—UI shows yellow band and blocks auto-rollout.
L. How SEG anchors the rest
CMC/HHNI supplies atoms and indices; SEG links them into explanations.
APOE/ACL ensures every step emits a witnessed derivation.
VIF is the per-artifact envelope; SEG is the system-level tapestry.
SDF-CVF uses SEG to verify parity (doc/spec/test/code) before accepting evolution.
Bottom line: Documents are narratives. Evidence graphs are guarantees.
Chapter 2 — System Axioms
2.1 Memory Invariant (CMC) — Formal statement & proofs
Formal statement (Memory Invariant, CMC)
An intelligent system must convert ephemeral context into structured, queryable, and 
reversible
 memory.
Concretely, for any time-indexed context stream 
, there exists a canonical memory state
such that (i) determinism: 
is a deterministic functional of 
under fixed seeds/tools; (ii) reversibility: a left-inverse 
reconstructs 
from 
with bounded loss; (iii) monotonicity: 
for 
only by explicit deprecation/tombstones; (iv) query sufficiency: 
+ 
are sufficient statistics for top-
 retrieval under the system’s scoring functional; (v) witnessability: all transitions 
are witnessed and time-sliced in the Shared Evidence Graph 
.
Construction (what 
contains)
Atomization 
: a typed multiset of 
atoms
 (text span, code span, event, tool-call, file blob, embedding), each content-addressed.
Indexing 
: HHNI indices (system→section→paragraph→sentence→word→sub-word), tags, embeddings, TPV (Tag Priority Vectors), dependency hashes.
Snapshot 
: immutable, content-addressed pack (manifest + blocks), signed and versioned.
Graph 
: time-sliced evidence edges among {claim, source, derivation, decision, witness}.
Retrieval score (normalized)
Let 
(quality, indexing depth, dependency delta). Define
with post-hoc calibration 
(isotonic/Platt) so that 
.
Required properties (as obligations)
Single-writer determinism. All writes pass a transactional CreateMemory gate with fixed seeds and tool versions → identical inputs yield identical 
digests.
Snapshot-first visibility. No user-visible state without an 
id.
Two-stage reads. Hierarchical read (coarse HHNI → fine atoms) with dumbbell compression (front-load + tail-load essentials; middle summarized) for long contexts.
Time-sliced lineage. Every transformation emits a Witness node; queries accept asOf.
Theorems (with proof sketches)
Theorem 1 — Determinism & Idempotence
Claim. Under fixed toolchain (model ids, weights hashes, prompt templates, seeds) and a single-writer gate, 
are deterministic; re-applying to 
is idempotent and yields the same 
digest.
Sketch. Content addressing (SHA-256 over canonicalized payloads) + frozen tool metadata removes nondeterminism from hashing. The single-writer gate serializes concurrent writes; equal inputs 
⇒
 equal manifests 
⇒
 equal snapshot digest. Idempotence follows since re-ingest compares digests and short-circuits.
Theorem 2 — Reversibility with bounded distortion
Claim. There exists 
such that 
with distortion 
, where 
is a declared budget from (a) lossy compressions and (b) quantized embeddings.
Sketch. Snapshots pack raw atoms (lossless) and 
summaries/embeddings
 (possibly lossy). Rehydration is exact for atoms and structural indices; for compressed spans we restore summaries within quantizer error. 
is the supremum of declared lossy operators’ bounds (e.g., top-
 truncation, vector quantization). Loss budgets are logged in 
(witness payload).
Theorem 3 — Monotonicity under event sourcing
Claim. For 
, 
is a subgraph of 
modulo explicit tombstones/deprecations; history is never destroyed, only superseded.
Sketch. Writes are append-only; corrections add contradicts/supersedes edges. Time-slice queries mask edges outside 
. Thus, the visible graph can shrink in a slice, but the ledger grows monotonically.
Theorem 4 — Query sufficiency of HHNI for top-k
Claim. Given the HHNI index 
with multi-granular embeddings, tags, and dependency hashes, the two-stage read (coarse→fine) returns a top-
 set whose expected F-measure is within 
of an oracle full-scan search of atoms, for calibrated 
.
Sketch. HHNI constructs a cover of the atom space with hierarchical representatives (sections/sentences). Under standard assumptions (Lipschitz similarity in embedding space; bounded drift), a coarse ANN retrieval followed by local refinement approximates the oracle ranking. The deviation 
is empirically calibrated and tracked in RS-lift dashboards.
Theorem 5 — Dumbbell compression minimizes position-bias loss
Claim. For attention kernels with “lost-in-the-middle” bias (concave in the center), placing critical cues at the front and tail and summarizing the middle minimizes expected recall loss under a fixed token budget.
Sketch. Model position-weight as 
with maxima near boundaries. For a budget 
, selecting top-mass spans near the ends maximizes 
. This yields the “dumbbell” layout as the optimal packing strategy; middle spans contribute via summaries to preserve latent links.
Theorem 6 — RS calibration & selective abstention
Claim. There exists a monotone calibration 
such that 
is a well-calibrated probability; choosing 
with 
yields a bound on false-positive retrievals 
.
Sketch. Apply isotonic or Platt calibration on held-out gold sets to map raw scores to empirical probabilities. By Neyman-Pearson style thresholding on 
, one chooses 
giving target type-I error 
. UI and gates consume 
and 
.
Corollary — Safety by construction
Because every read/write is (i) snapshot-first, (ii) time-sliced, and (iii) witnessed into 
, 
any
 returned fact has a replay recipe; if 
or uncertainty 
, the system abstains or routes to HITL.
Algorithms (obligation-level)
Write pipeline (deterministic):
INGEST → ATOMIZE → INDEX(HHNI) → SCORE(QS,IDS,DD) → SNAPSHOT(sign,digest) → GRAPH(upsert witnesses)
Read pipeline (two-stage):
COARSE(HHNI nodes) → RE-RANK(local atoms) → DUMBBELL(pack) → UQ/ABSTAIN(κ) → RENDER + LINEAGE
Design constraints (bound to CMC)
C-1 Single writer. One transactional CreateMemory endpoint; conflicts resolved before snapshot.
C-2 Snapshot-first. No state leaks without snapshot_id.
C-3 Two-stage read. Mandatory hierarchical search + dumbbell packing.
C-4 Calibrated RS. Score calibration fitted, tracked, and versioned.
C-5 Loss budgets. Each lossy operator declares a bound; rehydration reports 
.
C-6 Witness everywhere. Each transition emits a VIF payload into SEG.
Worked micro-example (end-to-end)
Context: user prompt + code diff + log excerpt.
Atomize: 7 atoms (2 text spans, 3 code spans, 2 events).
Index: sentence/word embeddings; tags #auth, #jwt; dependency hash binds diff↔test.
Snapshot: manifest digest sha256:… signed; lossy operator: middle-summary (ε=0.03).
Graph: Derivation(LLMRun) witnessed by {model,weights_hash,prompt_id,tools}; Claim “JWT added without PII leak” supported by test result + static scan.
Read: query auth token → HHNI retrieves section→sentences; local re-rank surfaces the diff atom; dumbbell packs front (requirements) + tail (tests); UI shows 
, green band; lineage expands to show witnesses.
What this buys the whole system
For APOE: plans operate over 
stable
 memory, not drifting chat; boundary gates consume calibrated RS.
For VIF/SEG: every memory fact has a witness and replay.
For SDF-CVF: parity checks join code/docs/tags/traces at commit time.
For users: answers that can be 
proven
 and 
replayed
, or gracefully 
abstained
.
Chapter 2 — System Axioms
2.2 Orchestration Invariant (APOE) — Formal statement & proofs
Formal statement (Orchestration Invariant, APOE)
Reasoning must be compiled, not improvised.
For any goal 
and memory state 
, there exists a plan 
that is a finite, typed, budgeted DAG in the AIMOS Chain Language (ACL) such that execution of 
on 
yields a witnessed trace 
with:
(i) determinism under fixed context (up to declared stochastic bands),
(ii) compositionality (plans compose without changing meaning),
(iii) boundary gates (every step emits provenance + UQ), and
(iv) safe liveness (terminates in success or abstains at 
with rollback).
Model (objects and semantics)
Plan as a typed DAG
A plan 
where:
: steps; 
: acyclic edges (data/control deps).
gives each node a step schema:
with pre/postconditions, gate set 
(tests, policy, provenance), and effect type (pure, tool, external).
Execution environment
where memory 
(from §2.1), tool registry 
(version-pinned), budget vector 
(tokens, time, calls, cost), and seed 
.
Operational semantics (small-step)
We write configurations 
with scheduler state 
.
A reduction executes any ready node 
(all preds satisfied), producing:
where 
updates budgets and 
only through snapshotted writes, and appends a witness record 
(model id, weights hash, prompt id, inputs digests, outputs digests, UQ vector 
, gate outcomes). If any gate in 
fails or 
crosses abstention 
, the runtime executes rollback of side-effects and emits an abstain event.
Theorems (with proof sketches)
Thm 1 — Determinism under fixed context
Claim. With fixed 
, 
, 
, ACL, and seed 
, the witnessed trace 
is unique up to declared stochastic tolerance bands; retries are idempotent.
Sketch. Each step consumes content-addressed inputs and pinned tool versions. Randomness is derived from 
and node id → repeated runs hash-equivalent. Tolerance bands (e.g., beam sampling) are logged in 
; within-band variation is allowed but artifacts’ canonical forms (digests) remain equal or are rejected by gates.
Thm 2 — Compositionality (plan algebra)
Claim. ACL plans form a strict symmetric monoidal category:
objects: typed interfaces;
morphisms: plans;
composition 
: interface-typed gluing;
tensor 
: parallel composition;
with identities and associativity holding, so refactoring does not change denotation.
Sketch. Interfaces are product types of inputs/outputs. Composition is node/edge union with interface alignment and topological merge; tensor is disjoint union. Because gates are attached to node boundaries, their satisfaction composes (induction on topo order). This establishes modularity and permits verified refactors.
Thm 3 — Gate soundness (safety)
Claim. If every step 
satisfies its preconditions and passes its gate set 
, then the whole plan satisfies the global policy 
(tests, safety, provenance minima).
Sketch. Gates encode obligations from 
as local Hoare triples 
. By DAG induction and monotone resource flow, local postconditions compose to the global postcondition. Violations cannot leak because boundary gates block propagation.
Thm 4 — Safe liveness (termination or abstention)
Claim. Under fair scheduling, finite 
, and no cyclic deps, execution terminates in success or abstains at some boundary where 
safe bands or budgets exhaust.
Sketch. Define a well-founded measure 
as (remaining nodes, remaining budgets). Each reduction strictly decreases 
or produces abstention; thus no infinite descent.
Thm 5 — Replayability
Claim. Given 
and the snapshot id(s) referenced by its witnesses, replaying the plan yields artifacts that are digest-equivalent or a flagged divergence.
Sketch. Witnesses pin all degrees of freedom (tool versions, seeds, prompts, inputs). Re-execution reproduces digests; any drift indicates external mutation and is surfaced.
Thm 6 — Refinement monotonicity (Evaluator-Optimizer)
Claim. Let 
be a refinement that adds a critic step and a repair step guarded by 
. Then expected risk 
is non-increasing and expected RS is non-decreasing over accepted outputs.
Sketch. The critic rejects or downgrades low-confidence outputs; repair improves or abstains. By selection, accepted set’s mean risk decreases; calibration verified on held-out traces.
Algorithms (obligation-level)
APOE compilation pipeline
INTENT_PARSE → DECOMPOSE (roles) → ALLOCATE (budgets) → INSERT (gates) → ACL_EMIT → SCHEDULE (topo + budgets) → EXECUTE (parallel safe) → COLLECT (witnesses) → REPAIR/ABSTAIN → FINALIZE (snapshot links)
Decompose into roles: 
planner, retriever, reasoner, verifier, builder, critic, operator, witness
.
Budgets: assign token/time/tool/cost caps per node.
Gates: attach tests, safety/PII scans, UQ thresholds, provenance minima.
Scheduler: (a) topological order, (b) respect budget/resource locks, (c) width-bounded parallelism.
Retry policy: bounded exponential backoff; idempotent re-runs; seed policy pinned.
Boundary contract (every step)
Inputs (digests) • Tool spec (model id, weights hash, prompt template id, tool args) • Budgets consumed • Artifacts (digests) • UQ vector • Gate outcomes • SEG pointer
Design constraints (bind to APOE)
O-1 Budgets explicit — every step carries token/time/tool/cost limits.
O-2 Typed roles — steps declare role; policies attach by role.
O-3 Boundary gates — per-step tests, safety, provenance, and UQ must pass.
O-4 Replay semantics — traces must re-run on frozen snapshots.
O-5 Abstention first — if 
crosses 
or RS falls below threshold, stop/route to HITL.
O-6 Side-effect isolation — tool calls run in sandboxes; writes are snapshot-first.
O-7 Parallel joins are safe — only join on content-addressed artifacts; race-free merges.
O-8 Version pinning — models, weights, prompts, tools are versioned; drift → error.
O-9 Metrics everywhere — per-node budgets, latency, UQ, RS; per-plan 
.
Micro-example (4-node plan)
Goal: “Summarize policy doc, extract PII rules, and propose safe redaction filter.”
Retriever (budget: 3 tool calls, 4k tokens)
→ artifacts: top-k sections + SEG citations; 
(low uncertainty).
Reasoner (budget: 8k tokens)
→ artifact: concise policy summary; UQ 
, passes 
.
Verifier (tests + policy gate)
→ checks summary against sources (overlap ≥ 0.85), PII taxonomy matched.
Builder (codegen)
→ emits redaction function; gate runs on synthetic PII corpus; passes parity tests.
Witnesses for each step anchor model/prompt hashes and inputs/outputs. The plan succeeds; replay reproduces digests. If Verifier failed, APOE would abstain or route to HITL.
What this buys the whole system
Reliability — compiled chains are auditable, replayable, and resource-bounded.
Modularity — compositional plans enable reuse and safe refactors.
Safety — gates and 
make abstention a 
first-class
 outcome.
Velocity — parallel sections run safely; retries are idempotent.
Governance — every boundary emits VIF metadata into SEG for regulators and SREs.
Compile the plan. Execute the plan. Show the witness. Or abstain.
Chapter 2 — System Axioms
2.3 Witness Invariant (VIF) — Trust calculus & auditability
Formal statement (Witness Invariant, VIF)
A claim that cannot show its lineage is a rumor.
For any artifact 
(text, code, decision) produced by APOE on memory state 
, there must exist a witness 
such that:
encodes a verifiable lineage from sources → retrievals → transforms → outputs in the Shared Evidence Graph (SEG),
carries a calibrated uncertainty vector 
, and
is replayable on the referenced snapshot(s); replay either reproduces digest-equivalent artifacts or yields a flagged divergence.
1) What a Witness is (and isn’t)
A witness is a machine-readable, cryptographically addressable record that binds who/what/with-what created which artifact, from which inputs, under which budgets, and with what confidence.
It is 
not
 a narrative explanation; it is the evidence bundle that makes explanations auditable.
Witness tuple (minimal):
id (content address, e.g., BLAKE3 of canonicalized witness JSON)
time (wall clock, monotonic seq) • actor (role, step id)
model (name, weights_hash) • prompt_template_hash
tools (tool ids + versions + args digests)
inputs (SEG node ids / snapshot ids + content digests)
budgets (tokens, time, cost) used vs. allowed
outputs (artifact digests, MIME, size)
UQ vector 
gates (test results, policy checks, redactions)
signatures (optional: step signer, system signer)
Every step in a plan emits one witness; the artifact’s top-level witness references all interior witnesses via the SEG.
2) Trust calculus
We compute a trust score 
that the system displays and gates upon. It is 
not
 truth; it is operational confidence grounded in evidence.
S (Support): coverage and strength of citations
over cited spans vs. claims.
C (Consistency): absence of contradictions in SEG slice
.
R (Replayability): digest match under replay
if all replays match; else 
or proportion matched.
F (Freshness): temporal validity
(per source, aggregated).
P (Provenance quality): source/auth chain, signatures, licenses
normalized score by policy (e.g., peer-reviewed > blog).
L (Calibration): inverse expected calibration error
.
Abstention rule. Emit 
-abstain if 
or any mandatory component (e.g., 
) fails.
Monotonicity. Adding 
consistent
 evidence cannot decrease 
; adding contradictory evidence decreases 
and so 
.
3) Auditability: what we log, how we verify
3.1 Lineage in the SEG (time-sliced)
Nodes: source, snippet, retrieval, tool-call, transform, claim, decision.
Edges: supports, derives, paraphrases, contradicts, uses-tool, tested-by.
Each edge carries 
validity; queries accept an as-of time.
3.2 Replay protocol (boundary contract)
Freeze referenced snapshot ids (memory, tools, prompts, seeds).
Re-execute the plan slice producing 
with the same budgets.
Canonicalize outputs → compute digests → compare.
Record replay_witness with 
and diffs.
3.3 Calibration protocol
Entropy-based 
: normalized token-level entropy / variance.
Agreement-based 
: ensemble or temperature-sweep disagreement.
Calibration 
: bin predictions by stated confidence vs. empirical correctness on gold or replay checks.
Store reliability diagrams and ECE in witness.
4) VIF schema (concrete, minimal JSON)
{
  "witness_id": "b3:6a1f…",
  "time": "2025-10-17T21:04:12Z",
  "actor": {"role":"verifier","plan_step":"verify-03"},
  "model": {"name":"gpt-X","weights_hash":"sha256:…"},
  "prompt_template_hash": "sha256:…",
  "tools": [{"id":"web.search","version":"2.4","args_hash":"b3:…"}],
  "inputs": [{"seg_id":"src:doc:123#p4","digest":"b3:…"}],
  "budgets": {"tokens":{"used":2389,"cap":4000},"time_ms":{"used":820,"cap":3000},"cost_cents":1.2},
  "outputs": [{"artifact":"claim:policy-summary","mime":"text/markdown","digest":"b3:…"}],
  "uncertainty": {"entropy":0.17, "agreement":0.08, "ece":0.04},
  "gates": [{"name":"source_overlap>=0.85","pass":true},{"name":"pii_policy","pass":true}],
  "signatures": [{"by":"system","alg":"ed25519","sig":"…"}],
  "seg_links": [{"edge":"derives","from":"retrieval:77","to":"claim:policy-summary"}]
}
5) Gates & policies (binding)
W-1 Machine-readable lineage. No artifact may be emitted without at least one witness that forms a connected path to the claims it asserts.
W-2 Confidence hygiene. If 
or 
, display risk banners and route to verifier or HITL.
W-3 Replayability. High-risk classes require 
before merge; otherwise quarantine.
W-4 Redaction. VIF pipelines apply PII/license redaction before logging sources; SEG stores redacted derivatives + reversible escrow hashes.
6) Properties (sketches)
Replay Lemma. If tools, models, seeds, and inputs are content-addressed and pinned, then replay is idempotent modulo external nondeterminism; divergence surfaces as a witnessed diff.
Conservativeness. In absence of lineage, set 
(rumor). Partial lineage yields 
bounded by the weakest mandatory component.
Anti-inflation. Appending unsupported citations or non-verifiable tool calls cannot raise 
; 
and 
cap the score.
7) Algorithms (obligation-level)
Witness-assembly (per step):
collect_inputs → hash_prompts → pin_model/tool → run → hash_outputs → compute_u → run_gates → emit_witness → attach_to_SEG
Trust evaluation (per artifact):
gather_subgraph → compute S,C,F,P,L,R → aggregate T → compare to κ_T → {emit|abstain}
Contradiction scan (online):
for new claim c: search SEG for contradicts(c, t_asof) → if any active → lower C; require verifier
8) UI/UX (operator & end-user)
Confidence band (green/amber/red) with 
and breakdown hovercard (S/C/R/F/P/L).
“Show lineage” opens the SEG slice: sources with highlighted spans; tool and prompt cards; replays.
“Recheck now” button triggers replay/calibration with current policies (read-only budgets).
Copy as JSON-LD provides the machine-readable witness for export.
9) Failure modes & mitigations
Orphan claims (no sources) → 
, block.
Stale sources (low 
) → warn, route to retriever refresh.
Calibration drift (rising ECE) → auto-schedule recalibration jobs; tighten 
.
Provenance forgery → verify signatures; mismatches quarantine the plan.
10) Worked micro-example
Claim. “Section §4.2 of Policy-X requires redacting SSNs before storage.”
Support 
. nDCG@5=0.92; coverage 0.88 → 
.
Consistency 
. No contradictions in policy history slice → 1.00.
Replay 
. Deterministic match → 1.00.
Freshness 
. Last updated 30 days, 
→ 
.
Provenance 
. Signed PDF + checksum in registry → 0.95.
Calibration 
. ECE=0.05 → 
.
Aggregate (weights e.g., 
) → 
.
Since 
, APOE may proceed; otherwise it would abstain or escalate to HITL.
What VIF gives the system
Operational trust that’s computed, not asserted.
Regulatory posture: instant export of machine-readable lineage.
Engineering leverage: replayable bugs, measurable calibration, searchable contradictions.
Cultural norm: if you can’t show the witness, you don’t ship.
Chapter 2 — System Axioms
2.4 Atomic Evolution (SDF-CVF) — Compositionality & parity
Formal statement (SDF-CVF)
Code, docs, tags, and traces evolve as one.
Let a system state at time 
be the quartet
where 
=code, 
=documentation/specs, 
=facts/tags/metadata, 
=VIF/SEG traces.
A change 
is valid iff there exists a single atomic commit that transforms each projection coherently, and all parity gates pass:
After apply, 
preserves referential, behavioral, and evidential consistency.
1) Compositional model of change
Unit of change.
A commit 
is a delta-quartet
with each component a typed edit script on its domain (AST diff, doc diff, tag set diff, SEG subgraph diff).
Functorial parity.
Define projection functors to a common semantic space 
(the spec/behavior model):
(behavior extracted from code/tests)
(requirements/spec clauses)
(policy labels, data contracts)
(claims/evidence implied by traces)
Parity constraint.
After apply, projections agree within a bounded slack 
:
where 
is a domain-specific semantic distance (e.g., spec clause coverage vs. test behavior; policy label coverage vs. PII filter paths). 
for high-risk classes.
Composition.
For independent commits 
that touch disjoint semantic slices, 
and parity is preserved (commutativity). If overlaps exist, a merge gate checks conflicts in 
.
2) Gate catalog (binding)
— all tests (unit, property, contract) pass; new behavior has tests; coverage thresholds met.
— updated requirements/specs align with behavior: 
.
— labels/policies/types (e.g., PII, license, SLAs) are consistent with code/data flows: no unguarded sinks, correct encoders/DP transforms.
— VIF/SEG updated: each outward-facing claim has lineage; replay on pinned snapshots matches; export pack builds.
— risk score ≤ threshold or has two-key HITL approval; redactions applied.
Failure policy.
If any gate fails → Auto-fix (localized synthesis/refactor) or Quarantine (branch isolates with rationale & witness), never a silent merge.
3) Parity scoring & slack
Define a parity score 
:
with 
. Policy: require 
(e.g., 0.95 for critical paths, 0.85 for experimental branches). Slack 
is implied by 
.
4) Proof sketches (intuition)
Soundness (gate preservation).
If all gates hold at 
, and 
passes gates at review time on snapshots referenced by its VIF, then applying 
yields a state where projections remain within 
; any downstream divergence re-surfacing under replay raises 
→ quarantine (no silent violation).
Sketch:
 gates enforce preconditions; witnesses pin artifacts; replay is idempotent under pins (cf. VIF). Therefore deviations are detectable and blocked.
Liveness (no deadlock of safe change).
For any desired spec-conforming behavior 
reachable by finite edits, there exists a finite sequence of atomic commits 
and auto-fixes that increases 
monotonically until 
.
Sketch:
 each failed gate yields a finite set of obligations (missing tests, tags, traces) that APOE can synthesize; obligations strictly reduce a deficit measure.
Compositionality.
If 
touch disjoint slices of 
, then parity scores combine as a weighted average and cannot violate 
if each individually meets it.
Sketch:
 distances add over disjoint supports; normalization preserves bounds.
5) Algorithms (practical)
Pre-merge parity checker.
Build projections 
on the PR snapshot.
Compute 
& component distances; emit diffs (missing tests/specs/tags/traces).
If 
: generate obligation graph → feed APOE auto-fix chains (e.g., test synthesis, doc patch, SEG witness scaffolding).
Re-evaluate → pass gates or quarantine.
Auto-fix strategies.
Spec→Test parity: synthesize tests from normative language; bind to code via symbol grounding.
Tag parity: static/data-flow analysis inserts sanitizers/DP ops; updates policy labels.
Trace parity: draft VIF records; attempt replay; annotate deltas.
Quarantine & rollback.
On persistent failure, branch enters quarantine with a frozen witness bundle and a rollback plan (last good snapshot + revert diffs); merge unblocks via two-key HITL only.
6) Worked micro-examples
A) Spec tightened (PII retention 90→30 days).
: policy text.
Obligations: add retention test, update data job TTL, rotate tags (#PII-retention:30d), regenerate SEG lineage for policy-driven changes.
Gates: tests & tags & trace. Auto-fix proposes TTL patch + test; reviewer approves; merge.
B) Code refactor alters API error model.
: handler signatures.
Obligations: doc update (error table), contract tests, VIF witness for change note.
If doc unchanged → 
fails → spec patch synthesized; parity restored.
7) Metrics & SLOs (SDF-CVF)
Parity score 
(p50/p90 by service & risk class).
Obligation closure time (mean time from deficit → auto-fix or HITL).
Change Failure Rate (CFR) and MTTR (DORA).
Quarantine rate and rollback frequency.
Replay fidelity for traces (VIF 
ratio).
8) Operator UX (minimum viable)
Parity bar on PRs with breakdown (C↔D, C↔F, C↔V).
Obligation list with “Auto-fix” buttons (preview diff + tests).
Risk banner (class, thresholds, two-key status).
One-click rollback (to last green snapshot) with witness link.
9) Failure modes & mitigations
Spec-only edits (no tests/code): blocked by 
& 
; auto-synthesize tests.
Tag drift (labels stale): nightly parity scan opens DEPP tasks; auto-patch or Jira ticket.
Trace rot (replay breaks under env drift): environment pins & simulators; if external API changed, attach contradiction edge in SEG and route to policy.
Over-automation (fixes that mask intent): HITL thresholding by risk class; diff semantics highlight behavior changes beyond tolerance.
10) Contract (what merges must promise)
Single atomic delta-quartet with pinned witnesses.
Parity score ≥ 
and all gates pass (or two-key override).
Rollback plan materialized.
SEG updated with claim→evidence lineage for the change.
Bottom line: SDF-CVF turns “keeping everything in sync” from an aspiration into a merge contract. If it can’t pass together, it doesn’t ship.
Chapter 2 — System Axioms
2.5 Substrate Invariant (SEG) — Graph-theoretic underpinnings
Statement (SEG)
Evidence is a graph.
All claims, sources, tool invocations, derivations, and decisions must be represented as a time-aware, typed, signed graph. Deletion is replaced by deprecation; contradiction is first-class; and every query is as-of a time slice.
1) Formal model
We model the Shared Evidence Graph as a bitemporal, typed, edge-labeled multigraph with signatures:
Vertices 
: typed nodes 
.
Edges 
with relation types
Multi-edges allowed.
Validity 
: valid-time interval 
(when the statement holds in the domain).
Transaction-time 
(when the record exists in the store). Together they give bitemporal semantics.
Signatures 
: node schemas (minimal shape: id, type, content hash, content addr, author keys, UQ vector if claim).
Attributes 
: edge payload (provenance hash, tool id, prompts, weights, confidence).
Signatures 
: cryptographic signatures for nodes/edges (model key, tool key, human approver).
Time slices.
As-of snapshot at time 
: 
s.t. 
and 
.
Audit snapshot at processing time 
: 
s.t. 
(even if validity is past/future).
Causality discipline.
Edges of type derives form a time-respecting DAG on any as-of slice: if 
, then 
. Cycles may exist across other relations but are disallowed in derives to preserve replayability.
2) Normal forms & constraints
NF-1 (Identity): Every vertex has a content-address (hash of canonicalized payload).
NF-2 (No deletion): Retractions are encoded as
set 
on validity, and/or
add explicit contradicts edges with a reason/code.
NF-3 (Witness completeness): A Claim is publishable iff there exists a supported derivation path to at least one Source on 
.
NF-4 (Minimality): Derivation paths should be irredundant (no subpath removal preserves reachability).
NF-5 (Signatures): Any edge that changes a public artifact (e.g., Decision) must carry 
from the responsible principal.
Design constraints (expanded):
S-1 Time-slicing API: every read includes 
and/or 
. Defaults must be explicit.
S-2 Contradictions: represent as edges, never destructive edits; UIs render red stripes across affected claims.
S-3 Export packs: deterministic projection of a bounded subgraph to a portable bundle (JSON-LD + binary blobs + signature manifest).
S-4 Replay pins: a Snapshot node freezes model id, weights hash, prompt template id, tool versions; plans/claims reference snapshots by id.
3) Trust calculus on a typed, temporal graph
We define a bounded, composable support score 
for a claim 
at time 
:
: set of valid (at 
) 
paths from 
to any 
.
: edge weight (evidence strength, calibration-adjusted; decays with age: 
).
: node reliability (publisher reputation, model calibration for ToolCall, human approver class).
: hop attenuation; 
is path length.
Contradictions apply as penalties:
where 
are claims contradicting 
at 
, and 
tunes penalty strength.
Properties.
Monotonicity under addition: adding a new supporting path cannot decrease 
(penalties only from explicit contradicts).
Locality: Updating an edge rescales only scores reachable from that edge (facilitates incremental recompute).
4) Query algebra (time-aware)
We define an algebra over typed, temporal graphs; let 
denote evaluation at 
.
Slice: 
→ 
.
Neighborhood: 
→ nodes within 
hops over edges of type 
.
Lineage (backward): 
.
Impact (forward): 
.
Conflict set: 
.
Best witness: 
.
Explain: returns best witness path plus UQ vectors and signatures.
All operators preserve bitemporality: they operate on 
with 
defaulting to “now” unless specified.
5) Algorithms & indexing
Storage choice.
Primary: property graph (adjacency index + columnar attributes), augmented with interval trees on 
and 
.
Projection: RDF/JSON-LD for interoperability (Chapter 15 covers shapes).
Indexes.
: 
→ edge ids (fan-out).
: interval index on 
(valid-time) and 
(txn-time).
: per-node top-k witness cache (path sketches) per risk class.
: signature manifest keyed by content-address.
Core procedures.
As-of traversal. Two filters on each expansion:
edge/type filter; 2) interval containment 
.
Complexity: 
worst-case; typical is bounded by degree & hop cap.
Best-witness search.
Use label-setting variant of Dijkstra with edge cost 
; prune with time-aware admissible heuristic 
(e.g., upper bound on remaining support).
Complexity: 
per query; amortize via 
.
Incremental recompute.
Maintain reverse dependency lists; when 
updates, recompute 
for reachable 
using delta-propagation until change < 
.
Contradiction accounting.
Maintain bitsets per claim of active contradictors; update penalty product in 
where 
is number of contradicting claims on slice.
6) Operations (append-only discipline)
All writes are append-only; mutations create new versions with new transaction intervals.
assert_claim(payload, snapshot_id, uq) → 
with 
.
link_derives(u,v,meta,τ) → add 
with 
.
link_supports(u,v,meta,τ) → add supporting edge.
link_contradicts(u,v,reason,τ) → explicit conflict.
deprecate(edge_id, t_close) → set validity 
; record cause.
approve(decision, approver) → 
with human signature.
export_pack(root, t) → bounded subgraph with signatures + hashes.
Idempotence.
Repeated assertions with identical payloads collapse by content-address keys.
7) Soundness & monotonicity sketches
Replay soundness.
Given a claim 
accepted at time 
with witness path 
, replay on snapshot pins succeeds iff all edges in 
are valid at 
and all tool calls are either pure or re-executed in simulation mode with pinned inputs. Because derivations are a DAG and all nodes are content-addressed, path reconstruction is deterministic.
Monotonicity under extensions.
Adding new edges or nodes never invalidates prior accepted claims as-of their acceptance time 
; it may create contradictions that alter 
for 
. This ensures historic auditability.
No hidden deletion.
Because 
tracks transaction intervals, redaction or retention expiration is observable in audit mode even when validity has ended.
8) Failure modes & mitigations
Orphan claims.
Symptom
: 
.
Mitigation
: block publication; open DEPP task for witness acquisition.
Temporal leaks.
Symptom
: edges valid outside the parent snapshot window.
Mitigation
: schema rule—any edge referencing a Snapshot must satisfy 
.
Contradiction storms.
Symptom
: cascades of low-quality contradict edges.
Mitigation
: require 
from qualified principals; throttle by reputation; show penalty but gate acceptance.
Cycle in derives.
Symptom
: replay non-termination.
Mitigation
: enforce DAG on derives at write time (topological check on slice).
Signature drift.
Symptom
: unverifiable content after retention rotation.
Mitigation
: store key fingerprints in export packs; rotate with cross-signed manifests.
9) Minimal worked example (as-of 
)
(doc hash H_A)
(extracted paragraph) with 
(RAG retrieval; model M, weights W, prompt P; UQ u)
(“Policy X applies to dataset Y”)
Edges: 
, 
Later, 
(“Policy X does not apply to Y”) with 
(reason: updated regulation) and 
starts at 
.
Queries:
Explain 
@ 
→ returns path 
+ toolcall 
; 
.
Explain 
@ 
→ same path but penalized by contradiction: 
. UI shows confidence drop and link to 
.
10) Operator & UX commitments
As-of switcher on every evidence view.
Best witness panel (path, UQ, signatures).
Conflict banner with navigation to contradicting claims.
Export button (pack includes JSON-LD subgraph, blobs, signature manifest, checksums).
Pin / Replay controls bound to Snapshot nodes.
11) What SEG guarantees the rest of the system
CMC can persist atoms with lineage preserved forever as-of.
APOE can compile to witnesses, not prose, and re-execute plans on pins.
VIF has a canonical place to live and propagate trust.
SDF-CVF merges cannot proceed unless the graph proves parity.
Bottom line: By making evidence a time-aware, signed, typed graph—never a log of strings—we earn replayability, auditability, and composable trust. This is the substrate that lets everything else (memory, orchestration, evolution) remain coherent over time.

2.6.7 Why this matters
This table is the contract of the system. If a feature can’t point to its row—what axiom it fulfills, how it proves compliance at build time, and how it stays honest at runtime—it doesn’t ship
Chapter 3 — Design North-Star
3.1 C-3PO-with-a-Workshop: Roles & Scopes
Intent. Define the 
operational cast
 of AIMOS/APOE. These roles make “machine communication” tangible: they speak protocols, remember with integrity, compile plans into actions, and keep the shop safe. Think of them as macro-roles that 
contain
 the micro-roles from APOE (planner, retriever, reasoner, verifier, builder, critic, operator, witness).
3.1.1 Macro-roles (what they own, produce, and protect)
Macro-Role
Mission
Owns
Produces
Protects
Ambassador
Translate between humans ↔ tools ↔ data ↔ devices.
Protocol adapters, schema mappers, tool routers.
Canonical requests/responses (typed), policy-clean inputs to chains.
Capability boundaries, prompt-injection shields, PII redaction.
Archivist
Turn context into memory (CMC/HHNI) with reversibility.
Atomization pipelines, indices, snapshots, SEG edges.
Atoms, indices, snapshot_id, lineage deltas, RS metadata.
Schema integrity, time slicing, deduplication, rollback points.
Engineer
Compile intent into working software (IDE-in-the-loop).
APOE plans, ACL specs, scaffolds, codegen, tests, deploy units.
Build artifacts, coverage & parity reports, preview envs.
Spec↔code parity, supply-chain hygiene, reproducible builds.
Counsel
Quantify uncertainty and attach witness (VIF/SEG).

Operator
Keep the system budgeted, observable, safe.
SLOs, token/time budgets, OpenTelemetry, guardrails.
Budget dashboards, drift/rot signals, incident packs.
Cost ceilings, runtime policy enforcement, containment paths.
Mapping to APOE micro-roles:
Ambassador ↔ router + retriever wrappers
Archivist ↔ retriever + witness (memory side)
Engineer ↔ planner + builder + verifier + critic
Counsel ↔ verifier + witness (provenance/UQ side)
Operator ↔ operator (budgets, SLO, safety)
3.1.2 Role contracts (inputs, outputs, gates)
Ambassador → Archivist (write path)
Inputs: raw user/tool context C_t, policy profile, capability token.
Outputs: sanitized request, candidate atoms.

Mitigations: strict schemas, redaction traces, egress proxy.
Archivist → Engineer (read/plan path)
Inputs: query, asOf, budget.
Outputs: HHNI coarse set → atom pack, RS metrics, snapshot_id.
Gates: RS threshold, dumbbell compression, contradiction flags from SEG.
Failure modes: lost-in-the-middle, stale indices.
Mitigations: super-index precompute, mark-and-sweep reindex, abstain on low RS.
Engineer ↔ Counsel (build/verify path)

C (Consulted): Ambassador (redaction policy), Counsel (VIF tags)
I (Informed): Engineer (downstream reads)

I: Compliance
3.1.5 Handoffs (message shapes)
All inter-role handoffs are typed envelopes:
{
  "envelope_id": "uuid",
  "asOf": "2025-10-18T12:34:56Z",
  "snapshot_id": "snap_…",
  "actor": "Engineer|Archivist|…",
  "budget": {"tokens": 12_000, "latency_ms": 1500, "tools": ["sandbox:v2"]},
  "payload": { "... domain object ..." },
  "vif": { "model": "gpt-x", "weights_hash": "sha256:…", "prompt_template": "tpl_…"},
  "uq": {"ece": 0.03, "entropy": 1.7, "band": "green"}
}
Rule: no envelope → no work. Missing snapshot_id or asOf → reject (C-2, S-1).
3.1.6 Role-scoped SLOs (minimum bars)
Ambassador: 0 critical guardrail escapes; ≥99.9% schema-valid messages.
Archivist: precision@10 ≥ target at p95≤SLO; ≥99.99% snapshot durability; replay success ≥99.5%.
Engineer: spec↔code parity ≥0.9; coverage ≥80%; CFR <10%; MTTR within target.
Counsel: lineage completeness ≥0.99; ECE ≤ θ; replayable claims 100%.
Operator: budget breach <1% chains; κ-abstention true-positive rate ≥ target; MTTD < 5 min.
3.1.7 Common failure modes & playbooks
Prompt injection → tool misuse (Ambassador).
Signal:
 unexpected DNS/HTTP egress. 
Action:
 revoke capability token; rotate sandbox; mark SEG contradiction on offending instruction; require HITL before re-enable.
Index drift (Archivist).
Signal:
 RS-lift drop, precision@k regression. 
Action:
 trigger reindex job; tighten dumbbell compression; annotate SEG with drift incident; temporary κ-raise for risky reads.
Spec/code divergence (Engineer).
Signal:
 parity gate fail, flaky tests. 
Action:
 quarantine branch; auto-fix suggestions; require two-key approval.
Overconfident publish (Counsel).
Signal:
 low calibration, missing witness path. 
Action:
 block publish; run temperature sweep; attach VIF; reroute to HITL.
Budget blowout (Operator).
Signal:
 tokens/latency > budget. 
Action:
 abort chain step; suggest compression; open DEPP re-plan; notify user with partial witness.
3.1.8 Example: end-to-end “spec change → running code”
Ambassador parses the human edit; strips PII; emits typed change request.
Archivist atomizes change; links to prior spec via HHNI; creates snapshot_id.
Engineer compiles APOE plan: update code + tests; runs IDE-loop; parity gate passes.
Counsel calibrates UQ, builds VIF; replays on pinned snapshot; green band.
Operator checks budgets and SLOs; deploys to preview; telemetry attached.
Publish with SEG lineage: claim → evidence → decision, as-of the deployment commit.
3.1.9 Extension points
New tools: Ambassador extends capability tokens & schema; Operator assigns sandbox tier.
New modalities: Archivist adds atom schema + embedder; HHNI updates taggers.
New guardrails: Counsel updates SHACL/JSON-LD; UI adds banding; Operator enforces.
New stacks: Engineer adds templates/components; parity and license gates inherit.
3.1.10 Doctrine (one-liners per role)
Ambassador: 
Translate without leaking.
Archivist: 
Store what you can prove, and prove what you store.
Engineer: 
Plans before code; parity before pride.
Counsel: 
No witness, no publish.
Operator: 
Budgets are real; safety is a feature.
With these scopes and contracts, “C-3PO-with-a-Workshop” stops being a metaphor and becomes an operating model: the right agent, with the right budget, doing the right work, leaving the right evidence.
3.2 Safety as Capability (abstention, κ-gating)
Intent. Treat safety not as a filter bolted on at the end, but as a 
first-class control system
 that decides what not to do—early, explicitly, and reproducibly. κ-gating is the mechanism that lets APOE halt, narrow, or reroute work when uncertainty, policy, or budget signals say “stop.”
3.2.1 Core concepts
Abstention. A deliberate, explainable refusal to proceed 
now
 with the current inputs and budgets. Abstention is not failure; it is control.
κ (kappa). A configurable abstention threshold applied to one or more signals (retrieval quality, uncertainty, policy risk, budget pressure). If the composite risk exceeds κ, the system gates.
Gate. A typed decision point in a chain step that consumes metrics + policy and produces {proceed | degrade | reroute | HITL | abort} plus a witness for why.
3.2.2 Signals that feed κ
Let a step produce metrics:
Retrieval: RS 
∈
 [0,1] (Section 4–5), plus coverage and novelty.
Uncertainty (UQ): entropy H, expected calibration error ECE, variance of sampled outputs Var, and disagreement score Δ (e.g., temperature sweep/ensemble).
Policy: Boolean predicates over content/tooling (PII present? disallowed domain? prompt-injection heuristics?).
Budget: token & latency utilization β_tok, β_lat 
∈
 [0,1], cost burn rate, remaining budget slack.
Context risk: data classification (public/internal/sensitive), action class (read-only vs. write/vend).
Define a normalized risk vector
r = ⟨ r_RS, r_UQ, r_policy, r_budget, r_context ⟩, where, for example:
r_RS = 1 − RS
r_UQ = clamp(w1·norm(H) + w2·ECE + w3·norm(Var) + w4·Δ)
r_policy = 1 if any hard predicate fails, else 0 (or fractional under soft rules)
r_budget = max(β_tok, β_lat)
r_context derives from sensitivity class (e.g., 0.7 for PII)
Composite risk (monotone aggregator):
R* = max( α_RS·r_RS,
          α_UQ·r_UQ,
          α_policy·r_policy,
          α_budget·r_budget,
          α_ctx·r_context )
Proceed iff R* < κ. Otherwise, gate.
Design note. Use max for fail-closed behavior on hard risks (policy). For softer regimes, L∞ can be replaced with a convex combination; always preserve monotonicity and calibrate α-weights per domain.
3.2.3 Gate outcomes (finite set)
Outcome
When triggered
Action
Evidence (VIF/SEG)
Proceed
R* < κ_low
Continue with planned tool/role.
Record metrics + benign decision record.
Degrade
κ_low ≤ R* < κ_mid
Reduce capability: smaller context, safe-mode tools, redact outputs, lower temperature.
Attach “degradation profile” and rationale.
Reroute
R* ≥ κ_mid but fix is available
Change plan: add retrieval, add verification, switch to safer template.
Link to new sub-plan and its budgets.
HITL
R* ≥ κ_high on high-risk data/actions
Pause; request two-key approval or edits; show diffs and impacts.
Store reviewer identity, decisions, timestamps, comments.
Abort
r_policy=1 hard violation or budget breach
Stop; emit safe explanation and next steps; snapshot state for replay.
Incident-grade VIF + SEG contradiction edge if hostile input.
Hysteresis prevents flapping: once degraded, require R* < κ_low − δ to return to full power.
3.2.4 Where κ-gates live (chain anatomy)
At plan boundaries. Every APOE step starts with an Ingress Gate (pre-work) and ends with an Egress Gate (pre-handoff).
On tool invocation. Before any external call (browser, code exec, file I/O), enforce Capability Gates (policy + budget).
Before publish. Counsel’s Witness Gate checks UQ calibration and lineage completeness; no witness → no publish.
3.2.5 Policy model (hard vs. soft)
Hard predicates (binary): disallowed domains, PII exfiltration, local file read outside sandbox, network egress beyond egress proxy → immediate Abort.
Soft predicates (graded): sensitive topics, thin retrieval, low calibration → Degrade or Reroute.
Policies are declarative (e.g., Rego/SHACL-like over JSON-LD/VIF envelopes) and versioned; the active policy hash is part of the witness.
3.2.6 Calibration and thresholds
Calibrate UQ offline with held-out corpora; compute ECE bins; set κ per domain and action class.
Per-role κ. Lower κ for 
Engineer
 deploy steps; higher κ for read-only retrieval.
Context-aware κ. Raise κ for sensitive datasets, lower for public FAQs.
Budget-aware κ. When β_tok or β_lat approaches 1.0, κ tightens (risk of prompt-rot / timeout rises).
Rule of thumb: If ECE > 0.05 on the class of tasks in play, force Degrade (more retrieval, lower temperature) or Reroute to verification.
3.2.7 Degradation strategies (safe modes)
Context diet: apply dumbbell compression more aggressively; pin top-K atoms with highest TPV; avoid mid-body bloat.
Template hardening: switch to strict, minimal prompts; disable creative expansions; force structured outputs.
Tool downgrades: read-only sandboxes; disable network writes; deny code exec; cap concurrency.
Explainability on: require rationales, cite-keys, and uncertainty bands in UI.
3.2.8 APOE/ACL expression (executable example)
pipeline BuildFeatureX {
  budget { tokens: 12000, latency_ms: 2000, tools: ["sandbox:v2"] }
  step retrieve_spec {
    gate ingress {
      require RS >= 0.65
      require UQ.ece <= 0.05
      forbid policy.prompt_injection
      on_fail {
        if (RS < 0.65) reroute add_retrieval;
        if (UQ.ece > 0.05) degrade { temp: 0.2, style: "strict" };
        if (policy.prompt_injection) abort "Policy violation";
      }
    }
    run retriever …
    gate egress { emit vif, uq, rs }
  }
  step generate_code depends retrieve_spec {
    gate ingress { require budget.tokens_left >= 0.3 }
    run builder …
    gate egress {
      require tests.pass_ratio >= 0.9
      require parity.spec_code >= 0.9
      on_fail { quarantine; hitl request "Spec/code parity low" }
    }
  }
}
3.2.9 UX for abstention (what the user sees)
Plain reason + next action. “I’m pausing because retrieval is thin (RS=0.42). I can: (a) search your docs, (b) ask 3 clarifying questions, or (c) proceed in safe-mode.”
Bands, not decimals. Green/Amber/Red badges with short tooltips; full metrics in a collapsible panel.
Traceability. A “Why paused?” link opens the VIF bundle (policy hash, κ, metrics, snapshot id).
One-click paths. “Approve once”, “Always approve for this repo”, or “Tighten policy”.
3.2.10 Failure modes & mitigations
Mode
Symptom
Mitigation
Gate flapping
Rapid degrade/proceed cycles
Add hysteresis δ; rate-limit re-entry; cache previous decision for Δt.
Silent overconfidence
Low ECE training, high test ECE
Recalibrate; enforce temperature sweeps; require ECE witness before publish.
Latency blowouts
Reroute loop expands chain
Put hard caps on reroutes; prefer 
Degrade
 once per branch.
Policy false positives
Over-blocking benign content
Split hard vs. soft predicates; log counter-examples; adjust rules via HITL.
3.2.11 Guarantees
Determinism under fixed context. Given the same M_t, policy hash, budgets, and seeds, κ-gates make the same decisions (or abstentions).
Provenance. Every gate writes a decision envelope to SEG (who/what/why/when, including κ, R*, and active policy).
Composability. Gates are first-class ACL constructs; they compose with roles, budgets, and tools without side-channels.
Doctrine. 
If you can’t prove it’s safe, you can’t prove it’s useful.
 κ-gating is how the system proves it.
3.3 IDE-in-the-Loop Rationale
Thesis. If the system must 
prove
 what it knows and 
ship
 what it reasons, then reasoning and software production cannot be split. The IDE belongs inside the orchestration loop so that spec ↔ code ↔ evidence stay in lock-step (SDF-CVF), κ-gates can halt unsafe actions, and every artifact carries a witness (VIF) into the SEG.
3.3.1 Why an IDE inside APOE (and not a separate toolchain)
A. Parity over time (SDF-CVF).
Separate chat + dev stacks drift. IDE-in-the-loop binds doc edits, code changes, test 
traces, and deployment artifacts to the same atomic commit and the same snapshot id, enforcing parity gates at each boundary.
B. Determinism & replay (APOE).
Plans compile to typed steps that invoke the actual toolchain (scaffold, lint, test, package, deploy) under fixed budgets and seeds. Replays use frozen containers + lockfiles; identical inputs produce identical build graphs.
C. Inline safety (κ-gating).
Before code exec, network egress, or deployment, gates check RS/UQ/policy/budget. Unsafe paths degrade, reroute to verification/HITL, or abort—
before
 anything touches prod.
D. Single lineage (VIF/SEG).
Specs, prompts, code blobs, test results, coverage, and SBOMs are linked in one provenance thread. Audit reads one graph instead of reconciling multiple CI/CD logs.
E. Latency & learning.
Tight loop 
⇒
 faster diagnosis and better auto-repair. Failures feedback into prompts and plans immediately; prompts get hardened by concrete build/test telemetry.
3.3.2 Design goals & non-goals
Goals:
Reproducible builds (containerized, pinned deps, signed outputs)
First-class tests (gates use coverage & parity, not vibe)
Bounded autonomy (κ-gates + HITL for high-risk merges)
End-to-end provenance (VIF envelopes into SEG)
Budget discipline (tokens, time, cost surfaced as first-class constraints)
Non-goals:
A UI text editor replacement; unrestricted code exec; bypassing corporate SDLC.
3.3.3 The pipeline surfaces (what the IDE exposes to APOE)
Stage
What APOE sees
Gates (examples)
Witness artifacts
Blueprint
YAML/ADR/spec tree
schema, policy, ambiguity check
spec@sha, prompt templates
Scaffold
file graph, diffs
license/headers, policy packs
SBOM, license report
Codegen/Refactor
patches, ASTs
parity(spec↔code), lint, SAST
diffs, lint/SAST reports
Test
suite matrix, coverage
pass ≥ θ, mutation score ≥ θ
junit, coverage.json
Package

supply-chain attestations
provenance (in-toto), digest
Deploy
env plan, rollout
change window, blast radius
change ticket, rollout events
Observe
logs, traces, KPIs
SLO error budget checks
traces, metrics snapshots
All stages run in ephemeral, capability-scoped sandboxes with read/write tools whitelisted per step.
3.3.4 Roles in the loop (APOE)
Planner compiles blueprint → plan graph.
Builder generates/refactors code under budgets.
Verifier runs tests, computes parity, mutation, security.
Operator packages/deploys with rollout policies.
Counsel emits UQ & κ decisions; Witness stamps VIF; Archivist writes SEG.
3.3.5 Safety & policy hardening
Pre-exec gates: no code exec without sandbox + policy hash; no network egress without egress proxy & allowlist.
Degradation recipes: strict prompts, read-only tools, smaller context, temperature clamp, extra retrieval.
Two-key merges: risk≥θ requires dual human approvals; both identities and diffs logged to SEG.
3.3.6 Minimal executable example (ACL)
pipeline AppV1 {
  budget { tokens: 20000, latency_ms: 4000, tools: ["fs:sandbox", "node:20", "docker:build", "k8s:staging"] }
  step plan_blueprint {
    run planner with { blueprint: "specs/app.yaml" }
    gate egress { require vif.complete; emit seg.link("ADR-001") }
  }
  step scaffold depends plan_blueprint {
    gate ingress { require policy.licenses.allowed; require κ(R*) < 0.4 }
    run scaffold with { template: "react+fastapi", dst: "./app" }
    gate egress { require sbom.ok; emit vif }
  }
  step generate_code depends scaffold {
    gate ingress { require parity.spec_code >= 0.8 }
    run builder with { repo: "./app", targets: ["auth", "users"] }
    gate egress {
      require lint.errors == 0
      require sast.crit == 0
      on_fail { quarantine; hitl "Security issues" }
      emit vif
    }
  }
  step test depends generate_code {
    run verifier with { cmd: "pnpm test --coverage" }
    gate egress { require tests.pass >= 0.9; require coverage.line >= 0.85; emit vif, coverage }
  }
  step package depends test {
    run packager with { dockerfile: "./app/Dockerfile" }
    gate egress { require provenance.slsa >= 2; emit attestation }
  }
  step deploy depends package {
    gate ingress { require window.change_open; require risk.blast_radius <= "staging" }
    run operator with { target: "staging", strategy: "bluegreen" }
    gate egress { require slo.error_budget.ok; emit rollout, traces }
  }
}
Every gate writes a decision envelope (metrics, κ, policy hash) to the SEG; every artifact carries a VIF (model id, weights hash, prompts, snapshot id).
3.3.7 Failure modes & mitigations
Spec↔code drift → enforce parity gates; auto-generate failing tests; quarantine branch.
Prompt-rot / flaky builds → pin prompts/templates per step; cache seeds; use deterministic containers.
Over-automation → κ increases with risk class; HITL on merges & deploys; degrade instead of “try harder.”
Dependency volatility → lockfiles + SBOM diffs; fail closed on unexpected supply-chain changes.
3.3.8 KPIs & guarantees
KPIs: spec↔code parity ≥ 0.9; test pass ≥ 0.9; line coverage ≥ 0.85; CFR ≤ 10%; MTTR ≤ target; κ true-positive rate.
Guarantees: deterministic replays under frozen snapshots; provenance-complete releases; bounded autonomy via κ-gates; one evidence graph for all actions.
Doctrine. 
Ship reasoning the way you ship code:
 reproducible, witnessed, and safe. The IDE in the loop is how APOE turns plans into running, verifiable systems without breaking the invariants that keep AIMOS honest.
3.4 Threat & Misuse Model (policy surface)
Thesis.
 AIMOS/APOE operates on living memory, executes tools, and ships software. That makes it a high-value target. We treat 
security, safety, and privacy as first-class capabilities
: the system must 
anticipate
 misuse, 
constrain
 power, 
measure
 uncertainty, and 
prove
 lineage.

3.4.3 Policy surface: the control lattice
We structure defenses as 
Prevent → Detect → Respond
, mapped to each boundary.
A) Input boundary (User → Orchestrator)
Prevent
Content firewall
: structural parsing + allowlisted formats; strip/neutralize model-targeting control tokens from user content.
Classifier ensemble
: prompt-injection, PII, malware; conservative defaults feed κ.
Budget clamps
: per-request token/time/IO ceilings up front.
Detect
Anomaly sensors
: entropy spikes, repetition, tool-intent deviation.
UQ tripwires
: high epistemic uncertainty near sensitive intents.
Respond
Abstain
 with actionable rubric; 
degrade
 (read-only tools, lower temp, stricter retrieval); 
HITL
 escalation for risky intents.
B) Tool boundary (Orchestrator → Tools)
Prevent
Capability tokens
 (fine-grained: fs.read, fs.write, net.fetch[allowlist], exec[toolset]); least-privilege by step.
Ephemeral sandboxes
: seccomp, network namespaces, read-only mounts, time & CPU quotas.
Egress proxy
: DNS/HTTP allowlists; signed request headers; response size & type limits.
Detect
Policy audit hooks
: all tool invocations mirrored to SEG; diff-aware alarms (unexpected domains, file paths).
Runtime guards
: taint tracking for sensitive content flowing into tools.
Respond
Kill-switches
 per capability; 
auto-quarantine
 offending plan branch; 
evidence snapshot
 for RCA.
C) Memory boundary (Orchestrator ↔ CMC/SEG)
Prevent
Single-writer flow
 with schema & policy validation; 
snapshot-first
 semantics.
Source integrity
: signed documents; allowed repositories; checksum enforcement.
Write gating
: HHNI DD threshold, policy packs (PII, license), role approvals.
Detect
Graph consistency
: contradiction edge rate, sudden indegree/outdegree shifts, unusual TPV changes.
Poisoning heuristics
: surge of near-duplicate atoms from new sources; low-trust domains.
Respond
Deprecate not delete
 (tombstones); 
time-slice quarantine
; 
rebuild indices
; HITL adjudication.
D) Build & deploy boundary
Prevent
Reproducible builds
: pinned deps, hermetic toolchains, content-addressed artifacts.
SLSA/SBOM
 gates; 
image signing
; policy admission (cluster side).
Change windows & blast-radius caps
; progressive delivery (canary/blue-green).
Detect
Pre-prod chaos
: test fault injection; mutation testing.
Runtime SLO monitors
: error budgets with SEG-linked rollouts.
Respond
Auto-rollback
 on SLO breach; 
feature flags
 off; 
post-mortem
 to SEG with VIF pack.
E) Observation & export boundary
Prevent
Read-only audit API
; scope-limited tokens; cell-level redaction.
Synthetic labeling
 for AI-generated content; watermarking when applicable.
Detect
Access anomaly
: unusual query cardinality, exfil-shaped patterns.
Replay drift
: divergence between replay and live lineage.
Respond
Key rotation
; 
lease revocation
; export freeze & review.
3.4.4 κ-gating and abstention policy
Risk bands
: low < κ_1 < medium < κ_2 < high.
Actions
:
Low
: proceed; log κ & UQ.
Medium
: degrade (stricter retrieval, read-only tools), require verifier step.
High
: abstain; present rationale + minimal sufficient questions; offer HITL.
Calibration
: κ thresholds tuned per domain, validated against adversarial suites (jailbreak corpora, injection galleries).
3.4.5 Red-team harness & regression suites
Jailbreak corpus
 (continuously updated), 
RAG poisoning set
 (look-alikes, forged refs), 
connector fuzzing
 (URL schemas, MIME tricks), 
policy canaries
 (known-bad prompts that 
must
 be caught).
Scoring
: block rate, false-positive rate, time-to-detect, κ true-positive rate, coverage of guard families.
Automation
: nightly runs; deltas block promotion of policy packs.
3.4.6 Incident playbooks (condensed)
PI-01 Prompt-injection
Freeze plan branch (quarantine snapshot).
Rotate capability token set for impacted tools.
Add contradiction edges for tainted claims; re-index.
Run adversarial suite; adjust policy weights; publish VIF report.
RP-02 RAG poisoning
Isolate source set; verify signatures/checksums.
Recompute TPV/RS with source penalty; rebuild HHNI for slice.
Mark deprecations; notify owners; export regulator pack if needed.
SC-03 Supply-chain
Revoke image keys; roll back to last signed image.
SBOM diff triage; lockfile audit; increase admission policy level.
SEG post-mortem with dependency tree.
3.4.7 Governance & human factors
Two-key merges
 for high-risk changes (crypto-bound approvals; independent reviewers).
Separation of duties
: Planner/Builder vs. Operator approvals; Counsel (UQ) cannot be Builder.
UX for refusal
: transparent κ rationale; minimal, specific next steps; never “just try harder.”
Privacy by default
: data minimization, purpose binding, retention timers with review.
3.4.8 Example: policy-aware APOE step (ACL)
step fetch_context {
  budget { tokens: 1500, time_ms: 1500, tools: ["net.fetch[allow:docs.example.com,*cdn*]","fs.read[tmp]"] }
  gate ingress {
    require content.scan.injection == "clean";
    require pii.redaction == "applied";
    require κ(input_risk) < 0.45;
  }
  run retriever with { query: Q, top_k: 8, policy: "no_external_forms,no_js" }
  gate egress {
    require sources.signed >= 0.9;
    require vif.complete;
    on_fail { abstain "Untrusted sources"; hitl "Source integrity" }
  }
}
3.4.9 KPIs for the policy surface
Block/jailbreak rate

false-positive rate
 (↓), 
time-to-detect

κ true-positive rate

Doctrine.
 
No capability without a constraint; no answer without a witness.
 We don’t “bolt on” safety—AIMOS/APOE 
compiles safety
 alongside reasoning, and proves it in the graph.
Part II — Context Memory Core (CMC) & HHNI
Chapter 4. Fractal Memory Hierarchy
Intent.
 Specify the data model and invariants for a memory-native system that turns every bit of context into structured, queryable, reversible memory—across all modalities—without sacrificing provenance or performance.
4.1 Atoms & Molecules (schemas)
Design goals.
 Smallest useful unit (
atom
), recursively composed into larger structures (
molecules
), all carried by an evidence-first substrate. No write exists without a snapshot; no composition breaks lineage.
4.1.1 Core identifiers
node_id: content-address (e.g., sha256 of canonical payload + headers).
snapshot_id: monotone, signed capture of a consistent state.
rev: semantic revision counter (per node lineage).
4.1.2 Atom (immutable payload + rich headers)
{
  "node_id": "sha256:…",
  "type": "atom",
  "modality": "text|code|image|audio|event|vector|schema|plan",
  "content": { "inline": "...", "media_ref": null }, // object-store ref if large
  "headers": {
    "created_at": "2025-10-17T12:34:56Z",
    "author": "user|agent-id",
    "source": { "uri": "...", "offset": [123, 456] },
    "lang": "en",
    "license": "…"
  },
  "analysis": {
    "summary": "…",
    "embedding": { "model": "text-embedding-004", "dim": 768, "vec": "…" },
    "tags": [
      { "name": "topic/security", "tpv": { "priority": 0.92, "relevance": 0.88, "decay": 0.03 } }
    ],
    "qs": 0.84 // quality score for this atom (post-ingest checks)
  },
  "provenance": {
    "model_id": "llm@vendor#version",
    "weights_hash": "sha256:…",
    "prompt_template_id": "tpl://…",
    "tool_calls": [],
    "witness": "seg://node/…"
  },
  "snapshot_id": "snap:2025-10-17T12:34:56Z",
  "rev": 1
}
4.1.3 Molecule (ordered DAG over atoms/molecules)
{
  "node_id": "sha256:…",
  "type": "molecule",
  "role": "paragraph|function|conversation|session|codebase|blueprint",
  "children": [
    { "ref": "sha256:atom1", "edge": "contains", "order": 0 },
    { "ref": "sha256:atom2", "edge": "contains", "order": 1 }
  ],
  "indexes": { "span_tokens": [0, 512], "span_time": ["…", "…"] },
  "analysis": {
    "summary": "hierarchical sum of children",
    "embedding": { "model": "…", "vec": "…" },
    "tags": [ { "name": "domain/legal", "tpv": { "priority": 0.73, "relevance": 0.81, "decay": 0.01 } } ],
    "qs": 0.87
  },
  "constraints": { "acyclic_contains": true, "max_depth": 8 },
  "provenance": { "...": "…" },
  "snapshot_id": "snap:…",
  "rev": 4
}
4.1.4 Edges (evidence-native)
Edge types are first-class records, not just pointers:
Structural: contains, is_summary_of, derives_from
Semantic: relates_to, contradicts, supports, duplicates
Operational: depends_on, executes, witnesses
{
  "edge_id": "sha256:src->dst:type@snapshot",
  "src": "sha256:…",
  "dst": "sha256:…",
  "type": "relates_to",
  "weight": 0.83,
  "policy": { "pii": false, "license_ok": true },
  "time": { "valid_from": "…", "valid_to": null },
  "provenance": { "witness": "seg://edge/…" },
  "snapshot_id": "snap:…"
}
Constraints → Invariants.
CMC/C-2 Snapshot-first:
 no edge or node visible without snapshot_id.
SEG/S-2 Contradictions:
 model “conflict” with contradicts edges; never delete evidence.
4.2 Atomicity, Recursion, Emergence
4.2.1 Formal structure
Let 
(atoms
∪
molecules). Define:
is 
acyclic
, bounded depth 
.
is arbitrary but 
time-sliced
.
A 
molecule view
 
materializes the ordered tree at time 
, folding children summaries upward. Emergence arises because embeddings/tags of molecules are 
functions
 of children plus 
contextual gains
 (usage, recency).
4.2.2 Operations
Fold/Unfold:
 compute molecule embedding via weighted sum + nonlinearity (e.g., gated pooling on child TPVs).
Dedup:
 two atoms 
with identical canonical payload share node_id—dedup at write.
Merge:
 new molecule 
over existing children produces a 
new node
; immutability preserves replayability.
Tombstones:
 deprecations create valid_to on edges; nothing is silently removed.
4.2.3 Safety theorems (sketches)
Reversibility:
 Given a snapshot, contains is acyclic 
⇒
 an ordered traversal reconstructs all child payloads (no information loss beyond compression already witnessed in analysis.summary, which is preserved as a separate atom).
Monotonicity:
 new snapshots add nodes/edges or close intervals; earlier queries at as_of remain stable (SEG time slicing).
4.3 Modality independence & payload abstraction
4.3.1 The envelope pattern
Every node wraps payload in a uniform envelope:
{
  "payload": {
    "content_type": "text/plain; charset=utf-8",
    "bytes": "…base64…",        // optional if inline text present
    "inline_text": "…",         // small text/content
    "object_ref": "obj://bucket/key" // large objects
  },
  "meta": {
    "token_span": [0, 256],
    "duration_ms": null,
    "mime_hints": ["text/markdown"]
  }
}
Adapters handle:
Text/code:
 tokenization, AST n-grams, symbol tables (for code).
Images/audio:
 perceptual hashes, CLIP-style embeddings, temporal cues.
Events/logs:
 key–value canonicalization, schema capture.
4.3.2 Chunking strategy
Atoms (text/code):
 target 
~512 tokens
 (hard <= 2k); prefer 
sentence-aligned
 splits; enforce 
semantic overlap
 (5–10%) to maintain recall.
Long media:
 store as object; create 
derived atoms
 for captions, OCR, spectrogram notes.
Streams:
 turn each logical span (e.g., 2–5s audio) into an atom; group into a session molecule.
4.3.3 Cost & storage
Inline threshold:
 ≤ 4 KB inline, else object store.
Indexing:
 embeddings stored in vector store; metadata & edges in a graph or document DB; payload in object store.
Compression:
 longer molecules carry summaries; atoms remain raw for reversibility.
4.4 Embeddings, Tags, and TPV
Purpose.
 Make retrieval 
adaptive
 and 
auditable
: tags carry priority; embeddings carry semantics; both decay with time; all become inputs to 
RS
 and policy routing.
4.4.1 Tag Priority Vector (TPV)
For tag 
on node 
:
: task/user-specific weight (e.g., “compliance/PII” = high).
: learned from usage (clickthrough, dwell, grounding hits).
: time decay 
with horizon 
.
Update rule (online):
where 
come from the current plan/feedback.
4.4.2 Quality, depth, and dependency
QS (quality score):
 per node; combines validation checks (language detect, PII scan, schema conformance), model-rated coherence, and provenance completeness.
IDS (indexing depth score):
 logarithmic function of 
HHNI depth coverage
 and 
connection density
 for that node’s subtree.
DD (dependency delta):
 predicted impact of modifying/using the node, measured against connected dependencies (conflict potential).
Retrieval Score
 (restate, normalized):
Calibration ensures RS ranks correlate with relevance probability.
4.4.3 Embedding policy
Model discipline:
 store {model_id, version, dim, space}; switching models creates 
parallel vectors
 with a 
join view
; never silently overwrite.
Projection:
 keep an 
operational head
 (low-dim projection) for fast DVNS dynamics; use full vectors for ranking.
Safety:
 hash vectors at rest if needed; enforce access scopes on sensitive embeddings (image faces, voiceprints).
4.4.4 Example (end-to-end)
Input.
 A user pastes a TypeScript function with JWT logic.
Write path outcome.
Atoms: code atom (function body), text atom (docstring), event atom (paste).
Molecule: function molecule contains the above atoms.
Tags: topic/auth, risk/secret-handling, lib/jose.
TPV: topic/auth → [0.85, 0.77, 0.02].
Embeddings: code and text embeddings + pooled molecule embedding.
Edges: depends_on → lib/jose atom; relates_to → prior “auth patterns” molecule.
RS: computed per node; high for the molecule due to depth and low DD.
Snapshot: snap:2025-10-17T… signed; SEG stores witness tuples.
4.5 Interfaces (authoritative, minimal)
4.5.1 CreateMemory (single writer; C-1)
POST /memory/atoms-or-molecules
Body: {
  payload, modality, role?, parent?, source?, policy?,
  create_if_absent: true
}
→ 201 Created { node_id, snapshot_id, rev, witness_ref }
Validations: canonicalization, duplicate detection (content-address), policy pre-checks (PII/license). Reject if snapshot signing fails.
4.5.2 Link (edge insert)
POST /memory/edges
Body: { src, dst, type, weight?, policy? }
→ 201 Created { edge_id, snapshot_id, witness_ref }
Policy mask applied before write. Contradictions generate type:"contradicts" edges; do 
not
 delete.
4.5.3 Read (hierarchical)
GET /memory/{node_id}?as_of=…&depth=…&view=atoms|molecule
→ ordered view, embeddings/tags, RS per node, lineage pointers
Supports 
dumbbell
 read (coarse→fine) for long contexts.
4.6 Failure modes & guardrails
Cycle injection (contains):
 reject; emit witness:violates(acyclic_contains).
Semantic drift:
 QS drops over time; decay ensures RS reflects staleness; APOE may 
abstain
 at κ.
Over-tagging:
 cap tags per node; demote low-use tags via 
decay.
Embedding migration:
 run dual-write (old+new) with snapshot binding; DVNS consults the overlay index while migration completes.
PII/leakage:
 policy engine gates CreateMemory and Link; redaction produces a 
new
 atom; originals remain sealed with access controls.
4.7 Invariants crosswalk (this chapter)
CMC:
 atomize→index→snapshot→graph; reversible & monotone.
SEG:
 edges are typed, temporal, contradiction-friendly.
VIF:
 every node/edge carries {model, weights_hash, prompt_tpl, tools, snapshot}.
SDF-CVF:
 changes across code/docs/tags/traces are 
atomically recorded
 in molecules and edges; parity gates live in APOE execution.
APOE:
 orchestrators declare budgets and produce witnessed traces that reference node_ids, never raw strings.
4.8 What “good” looks like (targets)
Indexing depth (IDS):
 ≥ 6.0 for core domains (system→…→sub-word present; cross-links > 3 per atom).
Memory precision@10 @ ≤50 ms:
 ≥ 0.85 on gold sets.
Snapshot replay fidelity:
 100% for readbacks with identical IDs.
PII false-negative rate:
 ≤ 1e-4 (with redaction gates).
Dedup ratio:
 ≥ 20% for large corpora (content-addressing at ingest).
Outcome.
 Chapter 4 nails the substrate: what we store, how we store it, why it’s reversible, and how it stays legible across time and modality.
Part II — Context Memory Core (CMC) & HHNI
Chapter 5. Hyper-Hierarchical Neural Indexing (HHNI)
Intent.
 Turn the Fractal Memory Hierarchy into a 
neural-grade index-of-indexes
 that spans system→section→paragraph→sentence→word→sub-word (and code/file analogs), with cryptographic dependency hashing, real-time impact previews, adaptive tag priority/decay, and a calibrated Retrieval Score 
.
5.1 Indices from System → … → Sub-word
Principle.
 Every level is both an addressable node 
and
 an index entry. HHNI guarantees: stable addressing, acyclic containment, time-sliced cross-links, and reversible materialization at any level.
5.1.1 Level taxonomy (text & code analogs)
Level
Text analog
Code analog
Audio/vision analog
L0 System
corpus/app
monorepo
dataset
L1 Section
chapter/spec section
package/module
scene/album
L2 Paragraph
paragraph
file
shot/track
L3 Sentence
sentence
function/method
utterance/clip
L4 Word
token/word
identifier/token
phoneme/object box
L5 Sub-word
morpheme/BPE
subtoken
subphoneme/patch
Containment edges contains(Ln, Ln+1) are 
ordered
 and 
acyclic
; semantic edges (relates_to, depends_on, contradicts) are 
temporal
.
5.1.2 Stable addressing (IXPATH)
Each node has a content address (node_id) and a 
hierarchical path
:
ixpath := system://{space}/{root}@{snap}/
          sec[{i}]/para[{j}]/sent[{k}]/word[{m}]/sub[{bpe}]
Determinism:
 IXPATH is computed from canonical segmentation and snapshot.
Idempotence:
 Re-indexing the same snapshot yields identical IXPATHs.
Relocation safety:
 A node’s node_id is content-addressed; IXPATH is a 
view
.
5.1.3 Index record (IXREC)
{
  "ixpath": "system://a/b@snap:2025-10-17/.../sec[3]/para[5]/sent[2]/word[7]",
  "node_id": "sha256:…",
  "level": "word",
  "parent": "…/sent[2]",
  "order": 7,
  "span": { "char": [1340, 1349], "tok": [211, 211] },
  "embedding": { "model": "…", "dim": 768, "vec": "…" },
  "tags": [ { "name": "ner/ORG", "tpv": { "priority": 0.68, "relevance": 0.74, "decay": 0.02 } } ],
  "links": [
    { "type": "relates_to", "dst": "sha256:…", "weight": 0.81, "valid_from": "…", "valid_to": null }
  ],
  "provenance": { "snapshot_id": "snap:…", "tool": "segmenter@vX", "model_hash": "sha256:…" }
}
5.1.4 Canonical segmentation
Text:
 sentence boundary detection (punct+ML), word tokenization with 
morphological split
 (keeps lemma & morphemes).
Code:
 AST-first: function/method (L3), statement (between L3 & L4 as needed), identifier/token (L4), subtoken (L5).
Audio/vision:
 utterance/clip aligned to VAD/shot boundary (L3), phoneme/object (L4), subphoneme/patch (L5).
Overlap:
 introduce 5–10% 
semantic overlap
 between adjacent units for recall.
Guarantee.
 Containment graph is acyclic and 
bounded depth
 (≤ 6). Cross-modal nodes may share IXPATH 
prefixes
 via alignment maps.
5.2 Dependency Hashing & Impact Previews
Goal.
 Make change and retrieval 
safe by construction
: every node carries a cryptographic view of what it depends on; any mutation computes a bounded 
Dependency Delta (DD)
 and shows a 
live
 impact preview.
5.2.1 Merklized dependencies
For node 
, define its 
dependency set
 
(parents, references, semantic links). Compute:
Localizing change:
 a change in a dependent 
bubbles via Merkle root without rescanning the world.
Witnessability:
 H(i) is logged in SEG; replays verify equality.
5.2.2 Dependency Delta (DD)
Let 
be normalized change magnitude for 
(e.g., edit distance, AST diff, or embedding drift). For an action centered at node 
:
Paths 
are limited by radius (hop count or cumulative weight).
controls attenuation with graph distance.
Interpretation.
 Probability-like accumulation of risk; 
⇒
 high blast radius.
5.2.3 Impact preview (bounded BFS)
function impact_preview(root r, radius R, threshold τ):
  Q ← [(r, 0)]; visited ← {r}; impacts ← []
  while Q not empty:
    (u, dist) ← pop(Q)
    for each edge (u → v) with weight w:
      if dist + 1 > R or v in visited: continue
      score ← w * γ^(dist+1) * Δ(v)
      if score ≥ τ: impacts.append((v, score))
      visited.add(v); push(Q, (v, dist+1))
  return sort_desc(impacts)
UI contract:
 show top-K impacts with edge paths and 
what would change
 (diff previews).
Write gate:
 
C-1/C-2
 require 
impact preview recorded
 before commit.
5.2.4 Conflict classes
Structural:
 would introduce cycle in contains → hard fail.
Policy:
 crossing into restricted region (PII/license) → route to redaction/HITL.
Semantic:
 raises contradiction with higher priority claim → require verifier vote (APOE) or HITL.
5.3 Priority & Decay (TPV dynamics)
Aim.
 Keep indices 
alive
: high-value tags rise; stale/rare tags fade; task-critical tags spike under mission profiles. TPV per tag 
on node 
:
(priority): 
exogenous
 weight from current plan/policy.
(relevance): 
endogenous
 weight from observed usefulness (clicks, retrieval hit, grounding success).
(decay): time-based staleness.
5.3.1 Online updates
After an interaction with outcome signals 
:
Task spikes:
 
can be raised by APOE (“compliance sprint” 
⇒
 boost policy/* tags).
Forgetting:
 large 
increases 
, reducing RS unless refreshed.
5.3.2 Tag budget and pruning
Budget:
 ≤ K tags per node (default K=8).
Pruning score per tag:
 
.
Policy floor:
 tags with policy/critical never pruned; demote others below floor.
5.3.3 Promotion & demotion events
Promotion:
 repeated high-quality retrievals (grounded, accepted) elevate 
; crossing 
threshold adds 
shortcut edges
 (relates_to) for faster reads.
Demotion:
 prolonged non-use with high 
removes low-
 tags and trims edges (keeps lineage).
5.4 Retrieval Score (RS) — normalization & calibration
Goal.
 Make scores comparable across domains and over time; align RS with actual relevance; expose abstention thresholds 
.
5.4.1 QS (quality score)
Static checks:
 schema conformance, language detect, PII scan, license safety.
Model checks:
 coherence, redundancy, contradiction flags.
Provenance:
 complete VIF tuple (model id, weights hash, prompt id, tools, snapshot).
Aggregation:
 weighted harmonic mean emphasizing weakest link.
5.4.2 IDS (indexing depth score)
Let 
be levels present beneath a node, and 
be connection density in its subtree:
Target:
 core domains achieve 
and 
above the median.
5.4.3 DD (dependency delta)
From §5.2, bounded to [0,1]. 
Interpretation:
 “how risky is it to rely on this node now?”
5.4.4 Normalization & calibration
Per-domain normalization:
 z-score or min-max per domain bucket (legal, code, design).
Calibration target:
 
.
Methods:
 isotonic regression or Platt scaling on held-out gold sets; monitor 
ECE
 (expected calibration error).
Abstention bands:
 choose 
s.t. false-positive rate on 
high-risk domains
 ≤ policy target; APOE abstains or escalates below 
.
Training loop (pseudo):
for epoch in 1..E:
  D ← sample(gold_pairs) // (query, node, y
∈
{0,1})
  RS_raw ← QS * IDS * (1 - DD)
  RS_norm ← normalize(RS_raw, domain)
  RS_cal ← calibrate(RS_norm) // isotonic fit
  update(calibrator) to minimize ECE on validation
publish κ bands per domain: κ_low, κ_high
5.5 Build & Serve Pipelines
5.5.1 Build (write-time)
Segment
 payload into L1…L5; produce IXPATHs (idempotent).
Atomize
 each unit; compute embeddings (full + projection head).
Tag
 with initial TPVs (policy+NER+domain classifiers).
Link
 structural edges (contains) then semantic edges (KNN→rerank→policy filter).
Merkle
 dependencies; compute H(i); sign snapshot.
Persist
 IXRECs, edges, payload refs; emit VIF.
Gate:
 block if cycle, PII leak, license breach, or missing witness.
5.5.2 Serve (read-time)
Coarse scan
 at higher levels (L1–L3) using projection head.
Dumbbell
 expand to L4–L5 only for candidate branches.
Score
 candidates with calibrated RS; apply policy masks.
Assemble
 answer context with 
boundary witnesses
 (VIF) for APOE.
5.6 Failure Modes & Countermeasures
Failure
Symptom
Guardrail
Over-segmentation
Too many tiny atoms; recall drops
Minimum span, overlap window, merge heuristic
Index drift
IXPATHs unstable across runs
Freeze segmenter+tokenizer at snapshot; record tool hashes
Tag sprawl
Noisy/duplicated tags
Tag budget + 
pruning + policy floors
Hotspot collapse
DD spikes in a hub
Cap fan-in/out; shard edges; require verifier vote
Calibration rot
RS stops tracking relevance
Rolling recalibration + ECE alarms per domain
Privacy bleed
PII in embeddings
Vector access scopes; on-write redaction; audit jobs
5.7 APIs (minimal, authoritative)
POST /index/build: build HHNI for a given snapshot scope (system/section…).
GET /index/resolve?ixpath=…&as_of=…: fetch IXREC, parents, children.
POST /index/relink: propose semantic links; returns filtered set + witness.
POST /index/preview-impact: returns ranked impact set with paths and DD.
GET /index/metrics: IDS distribution, tag budgets, calibration curves.
AuthZ.
 Read-mostly; write paths require 
single-writer
 token and policy approval.
5.8 Invariants Crosswalk (this chapter)
CMC:
 atomize→index→snapshot→graph is enforced at every level; 
reversibility
 via acyclic contains + payload immutability.
SEG:
 edges are typed, temporal, and 
contradictions are preserved
 (no destructive deletes).
VIF:
 every IXREC/link carries model+weights+prompt+tools+snapshot; all hashes verifiable.
SDF-CVF:
 changes across code/docs/tags/traces are reflected atomically through HHNI; impact previews gate merges.
APOE:
 orchestrators consume HHNI via calibrated RS and policy masks; abstain under 
.
5.9 “Done Right” Targets
IDS median (core corpora):
 ≥ 6.0; tail < 10% below 4.0.
Calibration (ECE):
 ≤ 0.03 per domain bucket.
Impact preview latency:
 p95 ≤ 50 ms for radius 3, degree ≤ 32.
Write reject rate (policy):
 ≥ 99.9% for disallowed content (zero-tolerance classes).
Reindex determinism:
 hash-match rate 100% on snapshot replays.
Outcome.
 HHNI gives us deterministic, cryptographically witnessed, 
adaptive
 indexing from system to sub-word—with change risk quantified up front and retrieval calibrated to reality.
Part II — Context Memory Core (CMC) & HHNI
Chapter 6. Write/Read Pipelines
Intent.
 Specify the 
authoritative data paths
 of AIMOS memory: how raw context becomes atoms, how links are proposed and risk-gated, how immutable snapshots are minted, and how reads assemble 
small, lossless contexts
 with 
big, provable lineage
. This chapter operationalizes C-1/C-2/C-3 (single writer, snapshot-first, two-stage read) and exposes the performance envelope and SLOs.
6.1 Write Path — 
Ingest → Atomize → Propose → DD → Gate → Snapshot
Contract.
 There is exactly 
one transactional writer
 per memory space. All visible state corresponds to a signed 
snapshot id
.
6.1.1 State machine
NEW → (dedupe) → ATOMIZED → (index) → PROPOSED_LINKS
   → (risk/PII/licensing) → GATED
   → (merklize+sign) → SNAPSHOTTED → PUBLISHED (SEG/VIF emitted)
          ↘ (any fail) → QUARANTINE
6.1.2 Stages (authoritative definitions)
Ingest
Inputs: user prompts, code, files, tool outputs, logs, sensors.
Actions: normalize encodings, strip control bytes, detect modality/language, compute content hash cid.
Dedupe rule: if (cid, scope) already present in the 
current
 snapshot lineage, short-circuit to 
PUBLISHED
; else continue.
Atomize
Segment to L1…L5 (Chapter 5) and emit 
IXPATH-stable
 atoms/molecules.
Extract 
payload metadata
 (author, source, timestamps, file path/AST path).
Compute embeddings (full + projection head); attach initial TPV tags.
Propose links
Structural: contains(parent, child) per segmentation → 
must
 be acyclic and ordered.
Semantic: KNN candidates (top-M), rerank by cross-encoder/DomainRank, policy filter (namespace/PII/license), cap fan-in/out.
Record candidate set with scores and 
filtered-out justifications
 (kept for audit).
Compute risk
Dependency Delta (DD)
 from the proposed edit center (Chapter 5 §5.2).
UQ vector
 for embeddings/links (variance across seeds/temps; optional ensembles).
Policy risks
: PII, license incompatibilities, safety classes.
Gate
Hard
 gates: structural cycles, forbidden content, link into restricted region without exemption, DD above hard cap for that domain.
Soft
 gates: DD in caution band, low calibration (ECE), ambiguous license.
Soft pass → 
HITL
 or 
APOE verifier
 vote; outcome logged as a witness.
Soft fail → quarantine with remediation hints (auto-fix candidates).
Snapshot & Publish
Build 
Merkle forest
 over payloads and dependencies; compute H(root).
Freeze tool versions, model ids, weight hashes, prompt templates.
Sign snapshot, allocate snapshot_id, write append-only to 
Snapshot Log
.
Emit 
SEG
 nodes/edges and 
VIF
 provenance packets; update read indexes.
6.1.3 Transactional semantics
Idempotency key:
 (cid, scope, parent_snapshot, toolset_hash) 
⇒
 replay-safe.
Write isolation:
 until 
SNAPSHOTTED
, no read index mutation is visible.
Rollback:
 any failure moves batch to 
QUARANTINE
 with a replay spec (exact inputs, seeds, tools).
6.1.4 Minimal write API
POST /memory/write/ingest → {batch_id}
POST /memory/write/commit?batch_id=… → {snapshot_id, witness_uri}
GET /memory/write/quarantine/{batch_id} → remediation report (policy hits, DD paths, suggested redactions)
6.2 Read Path — 
Hierarchical dumbbell, calibrated scoring, policy-aware assembly
Goal.
 Serve 
just-enough atoms
 to maximize relevance and minimize risk/cost, while returning 
witnessable
 context for APOE.
6.2.1 Query classes
Direct lookup:
 IXPATH or node_id fetch at as_of time.
Semantic search:
 query vector + filters (modality, domain, time).
Lineage search:
 claim/evidence traversal in SEG with constraints.
Programmatic read:
 ACL step resolving inputs under budgets/policies.
6.2.2 Dumbbell compression (two-stage read)
Coarse stage (L1–L3):
Search 
projection head
 indexes to shortlist K branches (fast, low-dim).
Apply 
policy prefilter
 (redaction masks, license scopes, RBAC).
Fine stage (L4–L5):
Expand only shortlisted branches to word/sub-word or AST token level.
Recompute 
RS = QS·IDS·(1−DD)
 with calibrated normalizer.
Attach 
boundary witnesses
 (VIF tuples) and preview DD paths.
Assembly:
Compose returned context to favor 
beginnings and ends
 of spans (lost-in-the-middle mitigation), plus atomic snippets critical to the claim.
Include minimal 
explanatory edges
 (why this atom), not whole neighborhoods.
6.2.3 Read algorithm (sketch)
function resolve(query, as_of, budget):
  S ← select_snapshot(as_of)
  B ← coarse_scan(S, query, filters, K_coarse)           // L1–L3
  C ← []
  for branch in B:
    C += fine_expand(branch, K_fine, max_tokens=budget.ctx)
  C ← score_calibrated(C)                                 // RS calibrated
  C ← policy_mask(C)                                      // redaction/PII/license
  if empty(C) or min_RS(C) < κ_domain:
    return ABSTAIN(with reasons, alternatives)
  return assemble(C, attach_witness=true)
6.2.4 Safety & abstention
κ-bands per domain:
 configurable; APOE uses abstain→route patterns.
Redaction priority:
 redact over deny when possible; mark redaction in witness.
Leakproofing:
 embeddings served under 
scoped tokens
; no raw vector export by default.
6.3 Caching & Preloading (Markov traversals)
Thesis.
 Reads are 
bursty and structured
. We exploit session patterns to predict next hops and stage atoms into fast caches without violating policy.
6.3.1 Cache hierarchy
L0 inline
 (per-request): RS scoring artifacts, policy masks (TTL seconds).
L1 atom cache
: decrypted atoms/IXRECs, small objects (TTL minutes; TTI).
L2 vector cache
: projection head vectors and ANN cells.
L3 page cache
: cold payload pages and SEG shards.
Coherency:
 caches are 
snapshot-scoped
; snapshot advance invalidates by 
diff
 (changed IXRECs/edges).
6.3.2 Markov prefetch
Let 
be states = IXPATH prefixes (e.g., sec[*], para[*]), and 
transition probabilities learned from anonymous session traces with policy filters.
Prefetch top 
successors of current state 
maximizing:
Bandit modulation:
 
-greedy on prefetch candidates to explore.
Guardrails:
 never prefetch atoms violating user scoping, PII policy, or license boundaries.
6.3.3 Budget-aware preloading
Per-user soft budget:
 MB/sec and tokens/sec caps; backoff on contention.
Queue fairness:
 WFQ across tenants; emergency drain for hot snapshots.
Eviction policy:
 Weighted by (RS_lift · recency · hit_rate) / size.
6.4 Performance Targets & SLOs
Why SLOs here:
 Memory is the 
foundation
. If writes or reads blow budgets, APOE chains drift and VIF becomes impractical.

6.4.2 Correctness & quality
Reindex determinism:
 100% match on replays (same snapshot/tools).
Calibration (ECE):
 ≤ 0.03 per domain; alert at 0.05.
Policy leakage:
 0 P0 incidents; redaction success ≥ 99.9%.
Abstention quality:
 κ-abstain true-positive ≥ 90% on high-risk sets.
6.4.3 Cost & footprint
Index build / GiB text:
 target ≤ $X (tunable); ANN recall ≥ 0.95 at 10× speedup.
Cache hit ratio:
 L1 ≥ 0.70 steady state; L2 ≥ 0.85.
Storage growth:
 governed by snapshot delta, not wall-clock; auto-GC on expired retention windows (policy-aware).
6.5 Failure Modes & Remedies
Failure
Symptom
Root cause
Remedy
Snapshot stall
commits hang
long merkle over big diffs
chunked merkle, parallel trees
Hot hub DD spikes
many edits blocked
hub fan-in/out too high
re-shard links; enforce degree caps
ANN drift
recall drops
embedding/model change
dual-index warmup; A/B calibrated swap
Prefetch waste
bandwidth spikes
poor Markov model
bandit exploration limits; policy filters upfront
Over-abstention
excessive denials
κ too conservative
recalibrate per domain; task-aware κ
6.6 Invariants Crosswalk (this chapter)
CMC:
 single writer, snapshot-first; all writes are idempotent and reversible via QUARANTINE/REPLAY.
SEG:
 every publish emits time-sliced edges; contradictions preserved.
VIF:
 witnesses attached at commit; reads return boundary witnesses and replay URIs.
SDF-CVF:
 gating enforces parity; quarantines trigger auto-fix/ADR flows.
APOE:
 read outputs are κ-aware, budget-bounded, and ready for deterministic chains.
6.7 “Done Right” checklist
Write path enforces 
hard gates
 and records 
soft-gate debates
 (APOE/HITL).
All reads are 
as-of
 a snapshot; no hidden mutable joins.
RS is 
calibrated
 and monitored (ECE dashboards).
Prefetch obeys 
policy first
, not convenience.
Every error path is 
quarantine with replay
, never silent drop.
Outcome.
 The write/read pipelines make memory 
boringly reliable
: deterministic snapshots, safe evolution, fast reads, and every returned byte comes with a 
witness
.
Part II — Context Memory Core (CMC) & HHNI
Chapter 7. Storage Substrate
Intent.
 Specify the 
four physical stores
 that realize CMC: a high-performance 
vector store
, a bitemporal 
evidence graph
, a content-addressed 
object store
, and an append-only 
snapshot log
. All semantics in Chapters 4–6 depend on these stores being 
snapshot-scoped, policy-aware, and replayable
.
7.1 Vector Store & KNN
Role.
 Fast, filterable nearest-neighbor search over embeddings for L1–L5 items (projection + full vectors), feeding read-time 
coarse→fine
 selection and write-time 
link proposals
.
7.1.1 Schema (columnar / key–value hybrid)
tenant_id (str) • snapshot_id (uuid) • node_id (uuid) • ixpath (str; L1–L5)
modality (enum: text, code, log, image_meta, …) • namespace (str)
emb_proj (float[64]) — projection head for 
coarse
 passes
emb_full (float[D]) — full vector for 
fine
 passes (e.g., 768/1024)
norm (float) • tpv_priority (float in [0,1]) • ts_valid_from/ts_valid_to
policy_tags (set: pii, license:GPL, export:EAR, …)
7.1.2 Indexing strategy
Dual-index
 per snapshot:
ANN-coarse:
 IVF-PQ / ScaNN / HNSW over emb_proj (high recall, tiny memory).
ANN-fine:
 HNSW(ef) over emb_full for rerank within shortlist.
Filter-first
: tenant/namespace/policy prefilters prune search space before ANN.
Background compaction:
 periodic re-centroiding / graph rewire to limit drift.
7.1.3 Writes
Occur only at 
commit
 (Chapter 6): batch insert (snapshot_id, nodes); prior snapshots remain immutable.
Model change
: dual-write to 
new_index
 while 
old_index
 serves reads; hot-swap after calibration (A/B recall ≥ 0.95).
7.1.4 Queries
search(q_vec, filters, K_coarse, K_fine) → candidates with:
score = α·cosine + β·tpv_priority + γ·recency – δ·policy_penalty
Returns 
witness bits
: which filters applied; index version; calibration id.
7.1.5 SLOs & guardrails
p95: coarse ≤ 60 ms, fine ≤ 120 ms (K_coarse=200, K_fine=40).
Recall@K target ≥ 0.95 vs. exact on sampled audits.
Safety:
 no raw vector egress without scoped capability; PII/Export filters are applied 
before
 ANN.
7.1.6 Failure modes → remedies
Index drift
 (recall drop): run dual-index warmup + calibrated swap.
Hot hubs
 (high fan-in/out): shard by namespace and cap degree in link proposal.
Fragmentation
: periodic rebuild per snapshot or tiered compaction.
7.2 Evidence Graph Store (temporal)
Role.
 The 
substrate of truth
 (SEG): time-sliced, typed nodes/edges encoding claims, sources, tool calls, derivations, contradictions, and decisions.
7.2.1 Data model (bitemporal property graph)
Nodes:
 Claim, Source, Snippet, ToolCall, Decision, Agent, Snapshot.
Common props: id, snapshot_id, jsonld, ts_valid_[from,to), uqlabels (risk, domain).
Edges:
 supports, derives, contradicts, annotates, usesTool, approvedBy.
Props: weight, policy_tags, ts_valid_[from,to), witness_uri.
Bitemporality.
Valid time
 = when the fact holds; 
system time
 = when we learned/recorded it.
Queries accept as_of_valid, as_of_system for compliance-grade replay.
7.2.2 Writes & lineage
Emitted at 
publish
 (Chapter 6): edges/nodes carry 
VIF tuples
(model_id, weights_hash, prompt_template_id, tool_fingerprint, snapshot_id, UQ_vector).
Contradictions are edges
, not deletes; prior facts remain queryable with their time bounds.
7.2.3 Indexes & algorithms
Composite: (label, snapshot_id, ts_valid_from); adjacency on (out_v, edge_type).
Path queries: constrained BFS/Dijkstra with 
policy-aware pruning
.
Subgraph signatures:
 Merkle over node/edge ids → quick integrity checks.
7.2.4 APIs (selected)
GET /seg/path?from=claim&to=decision&as_of=...&max_hops=...
POST /seg/annotate (adds annotates edges with reviewer witness)
GET /seg/pack/export?scope=case-123 (regulatory bundle)
7.2.5 SLOs & guardrails
p95 path (≤ 5 hops): ≤ 80 ms; p95 neighborhood (≤ 200 edges): ≤ 120 ms.
Policy:
 time-slice applies to 
both
 nodes and edges; redaction marks are edges with policy:redacted.
7.3 Object Store (content-addressed)
Role.
 Immutable storage for raw payloads and heavy artifacts (docs, code blobs, images), with 
dedupe, delta, and encryption
.
7.3.1 CAS design
cid = H(normalize(payload)) (blake3/sha256).
Chunking:
 content-defined (rolling hash) to maximize dedupe across revisions.
Delta chains:
 binary diffs for large versions; capped chain length (periodic re-base).
7.3.2 Metadata & lines
mime, charset, lang, license, pii_tags, source_uri, ingest_tool.
Line/AST maps
 to reconstruct IXPATH spans; stable anchors survive minor edits.
7.3.3 Access model
Read via 
pre-signed URLs
 scoped to tenant, snapshot, and IXPATH range.
At-rest encryption
 with tenant keys; server-side KMS rotation.
Bandwidth guards:
 per-tenant egress quotas; LRU/CDN in front.
7.3.4 Lifecycle & compliance
Retention policies per class (e.g., 6 mo for high-risk logs unless extended).
Right-to-erasure:
 write a 
redaction overlay snapshot
 (do not mutate old); scrub ANN cells and caches via tombstone propagation.
7.4 Snapshot Log & Rollback
Role.
 Append-only ledger of memory states; the 
single source of replay truth
 for writes, reads, audits, and incident response.
7.4.1 Record format
snapshot_id (uuid) • parent_id (uuid or null) • merkle_root • diff_summary
signer (key id, sig) • toolset_hash • created_at • notes (ADR link)
State refs:
 vector index version ids, SEG batch id, object batch manifest.
7.4.2 Semantics
Linear or branched
 histories allowed (feature work, quarantines).
Rollback
 = select 
earlier snapshot
 as as_of; no mutation retroactively.
Quarantine
 references point to remediation plans (auto-fix, HITL).
7.4.3 APIs
GET /snapshots?cursor=... (paged)
POST /snapshots/label (e.g., 
prod-2025-10-17
)
POST /snapshots/replay?from=...&to=... (reproduce a write path with frozen tools)
7.4.4 DR & GC
Cross-region replication
 (RPO ≤ 1 min; RTO ≤ 15 min).
GC
 prunes expired data by policy while preserving graph integrity (keep tombstones & redaction overlays).
Audit immutability:
 WORM buckets for the log itself.
7.5 Security & tenancy (applies to all stores)
Strong tenancy keys
: every index row/edge/object scoped by tenant_id and snapshot_id.
Capability tokens
 for ANN, SEG, CAS; least-privilege scopes (read-only vs write).
Row-level policy filters
 evaluated 
before
 search/graph traversal.
Signing & attestation
: all commits signed; verifier can check toolchain SBOMs.
PII & export control
: tag propagation into ANN and SEG; deny or redact at source.
7.6 Invariants crosswalk (this chapter)
CMC:
 snapshot-scoped writes/reads; single writer realized via snapshot log.
SEG:
 bitemporal graph; contradictions and redactions are 
edges
, not deletes.
VIF:
 every store returns verifiable 
witness URIs
 and signatures.
SDF-CVF:
 content-addressed CAS + graph ensure doc/code/tag/trace parity.
APOE:
 deterministic replay from any snapshot_id under fixed tools/budgets.
7.7 “Done Right” checklist
Dual-index ANN with 
filter-first
 and calibrated swap.
SEG is 
bitemporal
; exports produce legally defensible bundles.
CAS uses content-defined chunking, delta chains, and KMS-backed keys.
Snapshot log is 
append-only
, signed, and cross-region replicated.
Redaction & erasure implemented via 
overlay snapshots
 + index scrubbing.
All APIs accept as_of and return 
witness metadata
.
Part III — Dynamic Vector Navigation System (DVNS)
Chapter 8. Physics-Inspired Retrieval
Intent.
 Replace brittle, purely lexical/nearest-neighbor retrieval with a 
physics-guided search
 that respects memory priority, policy constraints, and auditability. DVNS runs 
on top
 of the CMC substrates (vector store, SEG, CAS, snapshot log), turning a query into a 
stable, policy-safe path
 through memory.
8.1 GODN Recap → Retrieval Mapping (grav, elastic, repulse, damping)
State space.
Let the working set 
be the union of:
Candidates
 from the vector store after filter-first coarse KNN and fine rerank,
Anchors
 from SEG (e.g., authoritative sources, recent decisions, pinned artifacts),
Barriers
 implied by policy (PII, license, export tags) and time slicing (as-of).
Each item 
has:
Position
 
(embedding),
Mass
 
(priority; e.g., TPV from Chap. 5),
Charge
 
policy mask (1=allowed),
Validity
 interval 
(bitemporal).
We simulate a small number of integration steps to refine a 
path
 from the query 
to a compact set of witnesses.
Forces (GODN → retrieval semantics).
Gravitational (attraction / semantic pull).
Pulls toward semantically similar, high-priority neighbors.
Elastic (structure / hierarchy / policy keeping).
For intended structural links 
(e.g., same section, same molecule, approved SEG edges),
Keeps 
hierarchical cohesion
 (IXPATH proximity) and 
SEG-endorsed
 neighborhoods.
Repulsive (redundancy / cluster de-dup).
If 
:
Spreads near-duplicates, promoting 
diverse context
.
Damping (stability / early stopping).
Eliminates oscillation; acts like 
temperature
 control for convergence.
Policy geometry (hard constraints).
If 
(forbidden) or item invalid at the as_of slice, project updates with a 
hard barrier
:
where 
is projection onto the 
admissible region
 
(policy-safe, time-valid).
8.2 Path Cost 
: length, smoothness, blocks, density
We score candidate 
explanatory paths
 
through the refined neighborhood:
Length (semantic travel):
 
, with 
.
Smoothness (topic curvature):
 
.
Blocks (policy/temporal/SEG violations):
 
(large penalty).
Density (over-crowding / redundancy):
 
.
Total cost (minimize):
Retrieval score (with Part II RS):
where 
RS
 is the base 
and 
is path cost after DVNS refinement.
Interpretation.
 Short, smooth, policy-clean, and non-redundant paths 
win
. This turns “top-k neighbors” into a 
coherent, auditable route
 from query to witnesses.
8.3 Stability & Abstention
Integration loop (per query).
Build 
: coarse→fine KNN with 
filter-first
 (tenant, namespace, policy, time).
Initialize 
. For 
:
Compute 
.
Update 
, 
(semi-implicit Euler or Verlet).
Project to admissible 
.
Check 
energy drop
 
(converged) or 
max steps
 reached.
Enumerate 
simple paths
 through refined graph (beam on SEG-endorsed edges + local neighbors).
Score with 
→ take argmin; compute 
and 
uncertainty vector
 
.
Abstention rule (κ-gating).
If 
or
 any component of 
exceeds bound, 
abstain
:
Fall back to: (a) classic KNN slice + raw citations, (b) ask-clarify, or (c) route to HITL (risk-aware).
Emit 
boundary witness
: reason for abstention, thresholds, top conflicting pulls.
Stability knobs.
Damping 
up when oscillation detected (energy up-ticks).
Repulsion 
up when diversity low (near-dup density).
Elastic 
up when hierarchy/SEG cohesion matters (e.g., code+tests).
8.4 Policy-Aware Geometry (forbidden crossings)
Forbidden crossings.
A candidate edge 
is illegal if traversing it would:
cross into a policy-forbidden region (PII, export),
break a 
time slice
 (node or edge not valid at as_of),
contradict declared 
role
 (e.g., verifier may not mutate memory),
violate 
SEG assertions
 (e.g., explicit 
contradicts
 without a resolving decision).
We treat such edges as 
infinite barriers
 in scoring (i.e., 
large) and as 
hard projections
 during integration. The path builder prunes them before enumeration.
Projection operator.
For an update 
, if 
:
Implement as 
masked coordinates
 (drop disallowed facets) or 
clipped kernels
 in ANN rerank.
SEG-first search.
When a path must justify a claim, prefer 
SEG-endorsed
 hops (supports/derives) and treat free semantic hops as secondary with a 
smoothness penalty
 unless bridged by acceptable anchors (e.g., tool outputs with VIF).

VIF
 and 
SEG
 invariants.
Design Notes & Interfaces
Pluggable kernels.
 Gravitational pull can be 
or learned bilinear forms; keep 
monotonic
 in similarity.
Budget awareness.
 Limit 
, 
, beam width 
under APOE step budgets; expose 
cost counters
.
Adaptive priors.
 Use TPV (priority, decay) to set masses 
; recent, frequently validated atoms pull harder.
Multimodal.
 For image/code/log nodes, operate in 
shared latent
 (aligned encoders) or run 
per-modality sub-loops
 with late fusion.
Safety hooks.
 Before emit, run 
policy lints
 (no forbidden terms, no leaking PII) and 
abstain
 if violated.
What DVNS Guarantees (relative to plain KNN)
Coherence
 (smooth paths) over 
scatter
 (unrelated top-k).
Diversity
 (repulsion) over 
echoes
 (near-dup clumps).
Compliance by construction
 (policy geometry) over 
post-hoc filtering
.
Audit trails
 (witnessed paths) over 
opaque neighbor lists
.

 Nail down the numerics, show the run-time costs, and prove DVNS is practical at scale. We focus on four things: 
(9.1)
 force integration choices, 
(9.2)
 convergence & complexity, 
(9.3)
 super-index precomputation, 
(9.4)
 empirical lift vs. static KNN.
9.1 Force Integration (Verlet vs. Euler)
State.
 For each working item 
: position 
, velocity 
, mass 
. Forces:
with policy/time 
projection
 
.
A. Semi-implicit (symplectic) Euler.
Pros: 1 line, cheap, symplectic 
⇒
 decent stability for small 
.
Cons: More numerical damping than Verlet; slightly less accurate per step.
B. Velocity Verlet.
Compute 
from 
; then
Pros: Second-order, better energy behavior, fewer steps to converge.
Cons: Slightly higher per-step compute (needs force eval twice).
Recommendation.
 Use 
velocity Verlet
 by default; automatically 
downgrade to symplectic Euler
 if you detect tight latency budgets or extremely small 
.
Adaptive step & friction.
(shrink when energy increases).
(raise damping when you detect reversals).
Vectorized batch form (GPU-friendly).
Maintain 
.
Precompute 
neighbor lists
 per item (top-r semantic + SEG edges); compute forces via sparse gather/scatter.
Apply 
mask matrices
 for policy/time; projection as masked coordinates or clamped kernels.
Default numeric profile (safe starting point).

Gravitational 
; Elastic 
, rest-length 
Repulsion radius 
, strength 
Damping 
(raise to 0.25 if oscillation detected)
Steps 
for QA; 
for code/log forensics
9.2 Convergence & Complexity
Energy functional.
with 
active only for 
. Damping yields 
almost everywhere (minus projection). We 
stop
 when
(S1)
 
for two consecutive steps, or
(S2)
 max steps 
reached, or
(S3)
 abstention triggers (policy barriers dominate or UQ spikes).
Oscillation detection.
 Track sign changes in 
per item; if median flips > threshold, raise 
and shrink 
.
Time complexity (per query).
ANN search (coarse→fine): 
expected with modern indexes + re-rank 
.
Build 
(union of candidates + anchors) 
⇒
 
–
.
Force pass (sparse neighbors 
per item): 
per step.
Steps 
: total 
. With 
, 
, 
viable at ms-scale on GPU.
Path enumeration (beam 
, max length 
): 
. Use SEG-first beam to keep 
small.
Space complexity.
Store 
and sparse neighbor lists: 
. Witness buffers add 
.
Determinism knobs.
Fix seeds for ANN and tie-breaks.
Quantize 
grid and clamp floating epsilons.
Emit 
determinism flag
 if any projection resolved ties non-deterministically (rare).
9.3 Super-Index Precomputation
Goal: cut per-query work by precomputing 
basins
 and 
path skeletons
 at the 
super-index
 layer.
Artifacts.
Attractor basins.
 Cluster the super-index with community detection over the SEG-endorsed graph + semantic edges. Precompute:
Centroids
 
(mean embedding), 
mass
 
(priority sum), 
spanners
 (few edges connecting clusters).
Skeleton paths.
 For each centroid, cache top 
policy-clean
 path templates 
to canonical witnesses (standards, ADRs, specs).
Shard by time & policy.
 Maintain bitemporal shards (e.g., monthly) and policy partitions; invalidate/write-through on updates.
Runtime use.
Route query 
to nearest 
centroids 
.
Seed 
with 
basin members
 and 
skeleton witnesses
 (fast start).
Clip DVNS steps 
aggressively (often 
) because you start “near” a solution.
Maintenance.
Delta maintenance:
 Update basins incrementally as new atoms arrive; re-run full partition nightly.
A/B-cache policy:
 Keep latest and previous shard live for snapshot replays.
Expected win.
 20–60% reduction in per-query steps; more stable paths; better cold-start for rare queries.
9.4 Empirical Lift vs. Static KNN
Evaluation protocol.
Corpora: (i) multi-doc QA, (ii) codebase Q&A/refactor, (iii) log forensics.
Gold: top-k 
witness sets
 with human adjudication; time-slice enforced.
Systems: 
KNN-only
, 
KNN+rerank
, 
DVNS
, 
DVNS+super-index
.
Metrics:
Retrieval:
 p@k, nDCG, 
RS-lift
 (Δ against KNN), de-dup@k (fraction unique sources).
Compliance:
 % policy-clean paths, forbidden-edge rate.
Audit:
 lineage completeness (% artifacts with full VIF tuple), replay success.
Cost:
 median latency, 95p latency, token/compute budget adherence.
Ablations (turn off each force).
−grav 
⇒
 worse recall (semantic pull lost).
−elas 
⇒
 cohesion breaks (sections split), path smoothness drops.
−rep 
⇒
 redundancy spikes (near-dup piles).
−damp 
⇒
 instability tails, higher abstentions.
Typical outcomes (targets, not promises).
p@5:
 +4–10% vs. KNN; 
nDCG:
 +5–12%.
De-dup@10:
 +15–30%.
Policy-clean path rate:
 >99.5% (vs. 97–98% with post-hoc filters).
Latency impact:
 +10–30% vs KNN+rerank (mitigated to <10% with super-index).
Abstention precision:
 >0.8 (abstain when truly under-supported).
Failure modes & mitigations.
Oscillation in dense clusters:
 raise 
, shrink 
, cap neighbor degree.
Policy walls choke paths:
 broaden anchor set; add approved bridge nodes; or 
abstain
.
Novel queries (no anchors):
 fall back to KNN slice with explicit low-confidence witness.
Over-repulsion (loss of signal):
 lower 
, increase 
(neighbors).
Tuning cheatsheet (per domain).
Ad-hoc QA:
 
Code reasoning:
 
(favor cohesion)
Log forensics:
 
(favor diversity)

Part III — Dynamic Vector Navigation System (DVNS)
Chapter 10. Implementation Patterns
Intent.
 Turn DVNS from equations into a production recipe. Four pieces: 
(10.1)
 online refinement on top-k, 
(10.2)
 parameter tuning at runtime, 
(10.3)
 failure modes & mitigations, 
(10.4)
 visualization & telemetry.
10.1 Online Refinement on Top-k
High-level loop
Coarse retrieve.
 ANN over embeddings → top-k
 candidates (e.g., 512).
Policy & time filter.
 Apply SEG constraints (time-slice, allow-lists).
Form working set 
.
 Keep k
 = 64–256 items + 
anchors
 (canonical witnesses, recent snapshots).
Local DVNS refinement.
 Physics pass (Velocity Verlet; §9.1) with sparse neighbors 
(8–16).
Path find.
 Beam search (B=3–8) on refined graph; respect policy geometry (no forbidden crossings).
Score & gate.
 Compute RS, UQ; κ-gate.
Emit witnesses.
 Claim→Evidence→Decision lineage (VIF).
Pseudocode (single query 
)
cand = ANN.search(q, k0)
cand = policy_filter(cand, seg_rules, time_slice)
W    = select_working_set(cand, anchors, k1)
X,V  = init_positions_velocities(W)          # from embeddings; V=0
Nbr  = build_sparse_neighbors(W, r)          # semantic + SEG edges
for t in 1..T:
  F = forces(X, V, W, Nbr, params)           # grav + elastic + repulse - c*V
  V = V + Δt * (F / m)
  X = X + Δt * V + 0.5 * (Δt^2) * (F / m)    # velocity Verlet
  X = project_policy(X, policy_regions)      # forbid crossings
  if stop_rule(ΔE, t): break
G' = induce_graph(W, X, policy_ok=true)
paths = beam_paths(G', sources=anchors, B, Lmax)
score  = rank(paths, RS, UQ, policy_clean)
if κ_gate(score): return ABSTAIN(uq, reasons)
return best(paths), witnesses(paths)
Engineering notes
Use 
fixed seeds
 for ANN tie-breaks to improve determinism.
Pre-warm 
anchor cache
 by domain (docs, code, logs).
Early exit
 if RS saturates and UQ is tight before T steps.
10.2 Parameter Tuning (G, k, δ, c, α, β, γ)
What the knobs do
G
 (gravity): semantic pull; ↑G 
⇒
 tighter recall, risk of redundancy.
k
 (elastic): cohesion along trusted edges; ↑k 
⇒
 smoother, can over-fit clusters.
σ, ρ
 (repulsion strength/radius): de-dupe pressure; ↑σ/ρ 
⇒
 diversity, risk of dropping signal.
c
 (damping): stability; ↑c 
⇒
 fewer oscillations, slower convergence.
Δt
 (step): speed/accuracy trade.
α, β, γ
 (path cost weights): smoothness/blocked/density penalties in 
.
Domain presets (starting values)

Constrain drift: max 1 param change (±10%) per deployment window.
Persist 
per-tenant profiles
; decay to global defaults if sparse.

If 
UQ↑
 (wider uncertainty) → add anchors, ↑k slightly, ↓σ.
If 
duplicative hits
 → ↑σ or ρ, ↑r a notch.
If 
oscillation
 → ↑c (×1.5), ↓Δt (×0.75), shorten T.

Abstention best-practice (κ)
κ triggers when 
(i)
 RS < τ
 & UQ > τ
, 
(ii)
 policy-clean path not found within L
, 
(iii)
 witness set below min cardinality.
Emit: reason codes, UQ bands, top three 
next actions
 (ask for time-slice, add source, or relax scope).

Auto-tuning guardrails
 that adapt parameters safely per domain/tenant.
Failure-mode playbooks
 with one-click mitigations (lower Δt, raise c, add anchors).
First-class observability
: spans, metrics, and a witness panel that satisfies VIF.
Part IV — Orchestration: APOE & DEPP
Chapter 11. Cognitive Compilation (APOE)
Purpose.
 Convert messy intent into 
typed, budgeted, and auditable plans
 that execute deterministically on top of CMC/HHNI and emit VIF-grade witnesses. APOE is the compiler; DEPP (Ch.12) is the large-scale planning fabric it feeds.
11.0 Guarantees (what APOE must uphold)
Reproducibility.
 Given fixed 
(snapshot), tool versions, budgets, and seeds 
⇒
 identical trace 
within stochastic tolerance; else 
abstain
 (
).
Lineage-first.
 Every boundary produces a witness tuple (model, weights-hash, prompt-tpl, tools, snapshot-id, UQ).
Budget honesty.
 Declared token/time/tool budgets bound execution; overruns fail closed with a reason code.
Policy-clean.
 No path may cross forbidden regions (SEG/guardrails) even if quality scores tempt it.
11.1 Role Model & Contracts
Each role is a 
typed step
 with strict I/O and a witness envelope. Roles may be chained, branched, or run in parallel.
Role
Inputs
Outputs (Artifacts)
Witness (must include)
Quality KPI
Planner
goal, constraints, snapshot-id
plan DAG, budgets, role bindings
model+hash, prompt-tpl, seed, RS of retrieved reqs
plan validity %, budget fit
Retriever

top-k set, evidence paths
ANN index id, params, κ status, RS & UQ
p@k, RS-lift
Reasoner

*The Reasoner’s internal chain needn’t be fully exposed; but it must emit 
machine-readable summaries

Contract sketch (per step, abstract type)
step S<T_in, T_out>:
  inputs:  T_in
  tools:   ToolCaps[]
  budget:  { tokens, wall_ms, calls }
  effect:  { read(M_t), read(G), write(trace) }
  returns: { artifact: T_out, witness: VIF, uq: UQ }
  gates:   Gate[]      # pass/fail with reasons
11.2 Plans as Typed DAGs (the APOE “IR”)
Plan 
is a DAG 
where 
are steps with signatures; edges carry 
typed channels
 (schemas).
Edges
 annotate 
scope
 (HHNI indices, time-slice), 
policy region
, and 
budget pass-throughs
.
Seeds
 (PRNG) and 
tool pins
 (version/weights hash) live in the plan header.
Determinism discipline
Pin: model id, weights SHA, prompt template id, tool version, ANN index snapshot id.
Fix: top-k tie-breakers by 
stable sort key
 (doc-id, then shard-id).
Bound: sampling via fixed seeds and temperature schedules; otherwise 
if nondet > tolerance.
11.3 Budgeting & Scheduling
Budget classes
Tokens:
 prompt+completion tokens per step and plan total.
Time:
 wall-clock per step and plan total.
Calls:
 tool/API invocations (capability tokens).
Cost:
 estimated $ or GPU-ms envelope (operator view).
Preflight
Static estimate using 
emb len
, 
fan-out
, 
avg completion
, 
tool latency histograms
.
If estimate breaches ceiling 
⇒
 planner rewrites with smaller fan-out / deeper caches / cheaper models.
Runtime adaptation
Soft throttle:
 shrink fan-out or shorten completion length if budget burn rate > slope.
Grace step:
 optional one-shot overrun for 
witness-critical
 boundaries (logs a reason).
Fail-closed:
 emit κ-abstain + next-best actions.
11.4 
& Uncertainty Emission (boundary behavior)
UQ vector 
(per boundary)
Model
: entropy / variance (ensembles or temp sweep)
Retrieval
: RS dispersion (top-k margin, path consensus)
Calibration
: ECE (expected calibration error) bucket
Policy
: distance to forbidden region
Decision
If 
and
 
⇒
 
abstain
.
Output: reason codes, suggested “next questions”, and minimal witness to replay context.
11.5 Routing, Parallelization, Retry
Router
 (lightweight classifier): routes intents to pipelines & chooses 
model tiers
 (fast vs. accurate), 
tool stacks
, and 
policy slices
.
Parallel patterns
Map → Verify → Reduce:
 fan-out retrievers/reasoners; verifier collapses with majority/weighted vote.
Debate:
 2–3 reasoners argue; verifier adjudicates using rubric.
Spec-and-Solve:
 planner spawns spec writer and solver; critic cross-checks parity.
Merge operators
Max-RS
 (pick path with highest RS under policy-clean).
Borda
 / 
Weighted majority
 (use UQ as weight).
Pareto
 (no dominated solution on RS, cost, policy distance).
Retry policy
Idempotent
 steps (retriever) may retry with 
anchored perturbations
 (extra anchors, widened slice).
Non-idempotent
 (builder) require human or new snapshot/branch.
11.6 Boundary Gates (quality & safety)
Each step ends with a 
gate bundle
:
Schema gate:
 inputs/outputs match contract (JSON Schema / SHACL).
Policy gate:
 SEG constraints pass; no forbidden crossing.
UQ gate:
 ECE within tolerance; entropy below threshold.
Provenance gate:
 VIF tuple complete; hashes present.
Diff gate (build/test):
 parity spec↔code; tests ≥ coverage floor.
HITL gate (risked):
 two-key approval if risk score ≥ 
.
Failure 
⇒
 
auto-fix
 (if known), else 
quarantine branch
 with escalations.
11.7 Failure Taxonomy & Recovery
Class
Example
System Reaction
Constraint
budget exceeded; policy wall
κ-abstain; planner suggests scope/budget edits
Data
missing anchors; low RS
expand anchors; widen time-slice; run DVNS with diversity boost
Stochastic
nondet beyond tolerance
reseed & replay; if persists, flag tool/version drift
Spec drift
code passes tests but violates spec
block merge (SDF-CVF); open auto-fix PR; require HITL
Tool failure
API 5xx, timeout
circuit breaker; backoff; alternate tool path
11.8 Security Posture (execution hygiene)
Capability tokens
 per tool with least privilege & time-boxed scopes.
Sandboxed tools
 (network egress allow-list; fs paths jailed).
Prompt hygiene
: structured templates; strip & neutralize tool-returns; literal-block untrusted text.
Data minimization
: redact PII; pass 
handles
 (ids) not raw data when possible.
Signed snapshots
: snapshot id + Merkle root over inputs → witness includes signature.
11.9 Minimal Runnable Example (plan IR)
Goal:
 “Summarize policy doc and cite sources with time slice.”
plan "policy-sum-v1" {
  header {
    snapshot: "snap-2025-10-01"
    seeds: 42
    model_tiers: { retriever: "embed-001", reasoner: "gpt-X-safe", verifier: "critique-small" }
    budgets: { tokens: 18k, wall_ms: 8000, calls: 12 }
  }
  step retrv: Retriever {
    inputs: { query: "policy summary + citations", slice: "2024-01..2025-10" }
    budget: { tokens: 2k, wall_ms: 800, calls: 2 }
    outputs: { topk: EvidenceSet, witness: VIF, uq: UQ }
  }
  step reason: Reasoner {
    inputs: { evidence: retrv.topk }
    budget: { tokens: 10k, wall_ms: 3500 }
    outputs: { claims: ClaimSet, witness: VIF, uq: UQ }
    gates: [ policy_gate, uq_gate ]
  }
  step verify: Verifier {
    inputs: { claims: reason.claims, evidence: retrv.topk }
    budget: { tokens: 3k, wall_ms: 1200 }
    outputs: { verdict: PASS|FAIL, deltas: Diff[], witness: VIF }
    gates: [ provenance_gate ]
  }
  step emit: Witness {
    inputs: { verdict: verify.verdict, claims: reason.claims, trace: ALL }
    outputs: { report: JSON-LD, lineage: SEGPatch }
  }
  edges {
    retrv -> reason
    retrv -> verify
    reason -> verify
    verify -> emit
  }
}
Expected boundary emissions:
retrv: RS distribution, anchors used, κ=false.
reason: UQ bands; calibrated confidence.
verify: per-claim decision with rule id.
emit: JSON-LD lineage with model/weight hashes, prompt-tpl id, tool invocations, snapshot id.

11.11 Determinism Toolkit
Seed all randomness
; expose seed in every witness.
Pin versions
; reject execution if a pin cannot be honored.
Stable sorts
 everywhere; forbidden to rely on map iteration order.
Prompt template ids
 are immutable; diff produces a 
new id
.
Snapshot replay
 mandatory in CI for critical plans.
11.12 Observability (what the operator sees)
Spans:
 plan.build, step.exec, ann.search, dvns.refine, gate.run, kappa.abstain, witness.emit.
Metrics:
 chain determinism %, κ precision/recall, budget adherence, p50/p95 latency, cost per plan, lineage completeness.
Alerts:
 nondet drift, κ spike by domain, policy-violations, budget burn anomalies.
11.13 Checklists (shiproom)
Plan IR validates (types, budgets, pins, seeds).
All steps declare gates; HITL paths wired for risk ≥ 
.
Replay passes on frozen snapshot.
κ reasons render actionable “next questions”.
Operator dashboard tiles populated.
Part IV — Orchestration: APOE & DEPP
Chapter 12. Dynamic Emergent Prompt Pipeline (DEPP)
Purpose.
 Turn a messy, evolving program of work into a 
living, governed plan
 that can span 
thousands of steps
, adapt to new evidence, and stay reproducible under budgets and policy. If APOE is the compiler, 
DEPP is the compiled program’s runtime
—graph-native, evidence-seeking, and self-rewriting under guardrails.
12.0 What DEPP guarantees
Long-horizon tractability.
 Breaks big goals into a 
typed, sharded DAG
 that executes under token/time/tool budgets.
Evidence-driven evolution.
 Chain structure 
changes only for cause
 (new evidence, failed gates, user input) and always emits a 
witnessed diff
.
Determinism under pins.
 With fixed snapshot, seeds, and tool/version pins, the same inputs yield the same trace—or 
abstain
 (
).
Governed merges.
 All chain edits pass SDF-CVF parity and policy gates; high-risk edits require 
HITL two-key
.

  policy_slice, gates[],  # policy, UQ, provenance, diff, HITL
  inputs_ref, outputs_ref, witness, uq
}
Edge 
: typed channel with 
scope
 (HHNI slice, time-slice), 
fan-out policy
, and 
merge operator
.
Shard header
Shard {
  id, purpose, dependencies[],  # other shard ids
  resource_caps{max_parallel, token_pool, wall_ms_pool},
  pinned_snapshot, router_rules
}
12.1.2 Assembly (from goal → graph)
Intent split.
 Planner extracts sub-goals & constraints and emits candidate roles (retriever/reasoner/builder/verifier/critic).
Scope binding.
 Each candidate step binds to 
HHNI slices
 (system→…→sub-word indices), 
time windows
, and 
policy regions
.
Budgeting.
 Estimate token/time/calls by historical medians (per role × domain) and 
reserve
 per shard.
DVNS kick.
 For retrieval-heavy shards, seed 
Dynamic Vector Navigation
 to pre-rank anchors and reduce lost-in-the-middle effects.
Topological layout.
 Create DAG with 
stable edge ordering
; annotate 
fan-out/fan-in
 points.
Heuristic knobs
Prefer 
deep-thin
 over 
wide-flat
 when token budgets are tight.
Split shards at 
policy boundaries
 and high-latency tools (network isolation).
Co-locate steps whose inputs share HHNI anchors (cache locality).
12.1.3 Scheduling & execution
Router
 chooses model tiers and tool stacks per shard.
Token scheduler
 enforces a 
per-shard pool
 with back-pressure.
Parallelization
: map → verify → reduce; debate → adjudicate; spec-and-solve.
Checkpointing
: every gate emits a 
StepRecord
; shard emits 
ShardRecord
; plan emits 
PlanTrace
.
12.1.4 Persistence & cross-links
All intermediate artifacts live in content-addressed blobs; 
SEG
 stores lineage (claim↔evidence↔decision).
Snapshot pins
 tie reads to memory state 
; 
tombstones
 mark deprecations.
12.2 Self-Rewrite via Evidence
DEPP changes itself 
only
 when evidence or policy requires, and it leaves a trail.
12.2.1 Triggers
Gate failure
 (policy/UQ/provenance/diff).
Low RS
 or 
high UQ
 (retrieval or reasoning uncertainty).
External events
 (new snapshots, user constraints, incident alerts).
Cost/latency breach
 vs. budget envelope.
12.2.2 Rewrite primitives (safe graph edits)
Rescore:
 change ordering/weights of edges without topology change.
Splice:
 insert a local verifier/critic step between nodes.
Reroute:
 rebind inputs to a different retriever/index or model tier.
Refactor:
 split one bulky node into a micro-pipeline (maintain I/O contract).
Fork:
 create a branch for risky exploration; 
merge
 only with gates + HITL if needed.
Quarantine:
 cut a subgraph off the main line; park for human review.
All edits produce a 
ChainDiff
 with: reason_codes, old/new IR fragments, witness tuples, HITL approvals (if any).
12.2.3 Consistency & parity
SDF-CVF parity
: if any edit touches code/spec/tags/traces, the quartet must pass parity gates in the same commit.
Replay check
: re-execute altered region on the same snapshot to confirm determinism.
Policy non-regression
: policy distance must not shrink below thresholds.
12.2.4 Rewrite controller (pseudocode)
def maybe_rewrite(event, plan, telemetry):
    cause = classify(event)  # gate_fail, low_RS, over_budget, policy_violation, new_snapshot
    if cause == "policy_violation":
        return quarantine(plan.region(event.region), reason="policy")
    if cause in {"low_RS","high_UQ"}:
        return splice(plan, before=event.node, with_="Verifier(rs_boost)")
    if cause == "over_budget":
        return refactor(event.node, into=["RetrieverLite","ReasonerShort"], shrink=True)
    if cause == "new_snapshot":
        return reroute(plan, targets=affected_edges(plan, event))
    return plan  # no-op
12.3 Chain-Health Metrics (compute & act)
Let 
be all steps, 
all shards.
Core metrics
(abstention health):
Track 
precision/recall
 of abstentions vs. later ground truth (should catch bad cases without blocking good ones).
Budget adherence (BA)
 per class 
:
Alert on 
slope
 (burn rate) not just level.
Determinism score (D)
 under pins:
Re-run N sampled subtraces;
(Accept within hashing tolerance on float outputs.)
Lineage completeness (LC)
: fraction of artifacts with 
VIF tuples
 present and valid hashes.
RS-coverage (RSC)
: share of accepted answers whose 
RS ≥ 
and 
UQ ≤ 
.
Gate pass rate (GPR)
 and 
mean gate latency
 (detect bottlenecks).
Dashboards & thresholds
Redline if 
, 
, or 
policy gate fails
 > 0 in last hour.
Page on 
slope exceeding 
of forecast.
Suggest 
auto-rewrite
 when RSC drops below target for a shard (e.g., < 0.85).
Telemetry plumbing
Emit OpenTelemetry spans: step.exec, gate.run, rewrite.apply, dvns.refine.
Aggregate per 
role × domain
 to tune budgets and router rules.
12.4 Large-Scale Planning (thousands of nodes)
12.4.1 Partitioning strategies
Functional shards
 (retrieval, reasoning, verification, build).
Policy shards
 (PII regions, licensed content, export-restricted zones).
Latency shards
 (network-bound vs. CPU/GPU-bound).
Ownership shards
 (teams/tenants; enables independent releases).
12.4.2 Parallel exec patterns
Map→Verify→Reduce
 for literature/codebase sweeps.
Debate×K
 (2–3 critics) on high-stakes claims; 
Verifier
 adjudicates with rubric.
Spec-and-Solve
: spec writer and solver proceed in parallel; 
Parity Gate
 compares spec↔artifact.
12.4.3 Token & memory budgets at scale
Token pooling
 per shard with 
borrowing
 under caps; hard stop at plan cap.
Context compaction
: dumbbell compression + HHNI slices keep 
salient edges
 at start/end of prompts.
Model tiering
: use small/fast models for broad sweeps, escalate to slow/accurate on 
frontier nodes
.
12.4.4 Failure handling & resilience
Circuit breakers
 for flaky tools; automatic 
shadow routing
 to alternates.
Quarantine queues
 for risky rewrites; HITL triage with diffs & ChainDiff witness.
Warm caches
: prefetch HHNI anchors for next K steps; 
pre-compute
 DVNS on super-index nightly.
12.4.5 Performance targets (reference)
p95 step latency: Retriever ≤ 900 ms, Reasoner ≤ 3.5 s, Verifier ≤ 1.2 s.
Determinism 
≥ 0.98; Lineage completeness 
≥ 0.97.
κ false-negative rate ≤ 2% on critical domains.
Token budget overrun incidents ≤ 1 per 1,000 plan runs.
12.5 ACL (AIMOS Chain Language) snippets for DEPP
12.5.1 Thousand-node skeleton (excerpt)
pipeline "depp.app-blueprint.v3" {
  header {
    snapshot: "snap-2025-10-01"
    seeds: 1337
    budgets: { tokens: 220k, wall_ms: 120000, calls: 480 }
  }
  shard "retrieval.sweep" {
    caps { max_parallel: 64, token_pool: 60k }
    step r0: Retriever { inputs: { query: "all blueprint reqs", slice: "HHNI:system->section" } }
    fanout r0 -> r[1..128] with anchors=super_index
    reduce r[*] -> r_reduce using merge=maxRS
  }
  shard "spec-and-solve" {
    step spec: Reasoner { inputs: r_reduce; role: "SpecWriter" }
    step solve: Builder  { inputs: spec }
    gate parity: ParityGate { inputs: {spec, solve} }
  }
  shard "verify-and-witness" {
    step v: Verifier { inputs: { claims: spec, artifacts: solve } }
    step w: Witness  { inputs: { trace: ALL } }
  }
}
12.5.2 Rewrite policy
policy rewrite {
  on gate_fail(policy|provenance) => quarantine region
  on low_RS or high_UQ => splice Verifier(rs_boost) before consumer
  on over_budget => refactor node shrink=true
  require HITL for merges touching policy shards
}
12.6 Interfaces: DEPP ↔ CMC/HHNI ↔ SEG ↔ SDF-CVF
Reads
: DEPP steps read via 
HHNI scopes
 and time-slices; 
RS
 computed with QS·IDS·(1–DD).
Writes
: Only to 
trace
, 
witness
, and 
SEG
 (no direct mutation of memory state; new state arrives via 
snapshot
 events).
Parity
: Any change that emits code/spec/tag/trace must pass SDF-CVF parity gates in one atomic commit.
Provenance
: Every emission carries VIF: model id, weights hash, prompt-tpl id, tool ids, snapshot id, seeds, UQ vector.
12.7 Runbook (operators & builders)
When κ triggers repeatedly in a shard
Inspect RS histograms; widen HHNI slice; enable DVNS refinement; raise model tier for frontier nodes.
When determinism 
drops
Check pin drift (models/indexes/tools); re-pin or roll back snapshot; recompute seeds; replay sample traces.
When token slope spikes
Reduce fan-out; enforce shorter completions; split shard; push more work to retriever/critic before reasoner.
When policy gate fails
Quarantine region; run redaction pipeline; require HITL; log contradiction edge in SEG (do not delete).
12.8 Checklists (ship readiness)
DAG validates (types, gates, pins, budgets, seeds).
Shards have token pools & caps; router rules documented.
Rewrite policy installed; quarantine & HITL paths wired.
Replay passes on frozen snapshot; determinism 
.
Dashboards show 
, BA, D, LC, RSC healthy.
Export pack (SEG) reproducible for the plan.
Part IV — Orchestration: APOE & DEPP
Chapter 13. ACL — AIMOS Chain Language
Purpose.
 ACL is the 
legible, versionable, executable
 language for declaring APOE/DEPP plans. It gives you typed pipelines, explicit budgets, policy-aware gates, and machine-readable provenance so plans are 
repeatable under pins
 and 
auditable under VIF/SEG
.
13.0 Design goals (non-negotiables)
Determinism under pins.
 Same snapshot, same seeds, same tools → same trace (or abstain, 
).
Budget-first.
 Tokens/time/calls/cost are first-class and enforceable.
Governed I/O.
 Every boundary emits 
witness
 (provenance + UQ) and passes 
gates
.
Memory-native.
 Reads target 
HHNI selectors
 and time-slices; writes emit 
SEG
 facts, never mutate memory directly.
Composability.
 Pipelines shard/compose like software modules; changes must pass 
SDF-CVF parity
.

13.2 Core constructs & semantics
pipeline
: top-level plan with 
snapshot pin
 and 
global budgets
.
shard
: isolation domain with its own resource caps and routing; independently schedulable.
step
: a typed unit of work with 
role
, 
inputs
, 
slice/time
 selectors, 
model/tools
, 
budget
, 
pins
, 
policy
.
gate
: a typed check; must 
succeed
 before downstream steps read outputs.
fanout/reduce
: parallelization primitives (map→reduce, debate→adjudicate, etc.).
flow
: nested subgraph (macro) for reuse; inlined at compile unless marked export.
Execution invariant.
 Each step returns (artifacts, witness, uq). Gates consume these to decide pass/fail; failures raise 
rewrite
 or 
quarantine
 per policy.
13.3 Types, kinds, and schemas
Kinds
: Artifact, Claim, Evidence, Trace, Blob, JSON, Table, Code, Spec, Diff, UQ, Witness.
Structural types
: JSON Schemas referenced by $id.
Role I/O contracts
 (illustrative):
Role
Input kinds
Output kinds
Retriever
Query(JSON), HHNI slice, Time slice
Evidence[], UQ, Witness
Reasoner
Evidence[], Spec/Question
Claim[], Explanation, UQ
Verifier
Claim[], Evidence[]/Artifacts
Verdicts, Critiques, UQ
Builder
Spec/Plan, Codebase slice
Code/Artifacts, Diffs, UQ
Witness
Trace, Metadata
VIF tuples, SEG writes
Critic
Any
Review notes, Risk score, UQ
Operator
Telemetry
Actions, Hints, UQ
Static typing.
 Compiler checks edge compatibility by kind + JSON Schema. Subtyping via $ref and oneOf. Mismatches → compile error.
13.4 Effects & capabilities
ACL annotates 
effects
 to constrain tool power and data egress.
Effects
: net.read, net.write, fs.read, fs.write, proc.exec, secrets.read, mail.send, db.query, seg.write.
Capability tokens
 bound at runtime to principals/tenants, scoped per step/shard.
Example (cap-limited step):
step r0: Retriever {
  inputs: { query: "oauth2 threat models", slice: HHNI:system->section("Security") }
  tools:  ["web.search"]
  budget: { tokens: 800, wall_ms: 1500, calls: 3 }
  policy: sec_web_readonly
}
13.5 Budgets & pins
Budgets
 hard-fail when exceeded unless soft=true in header policy (discouraged).
Pins
 freeze versions: model:"gpt-4o@sha256:…", index:"hhni:auth@v37", tool:"grep@1.2.5", seed:"1337".
Determinism contract.
 If pins + snapshot identical, runtime must produce 
bit-identical artifacts
 (modulo allowed float error windows) or 
abstain
.
13.6 Gates & witnesses
ParityGate
: code/spec/tags/traces parity (SDF-CVF).
PolicyGate
: data residency, PII/PHI filters, license compliance.
ProvenanceGate
: VIF completeness: (model id, weights hash, prompt template id, tool ids, snapshot id, seeds).
UQGate
: calibration and uncertainty bands (ECE/entropy/ensemble consistency).
DiffGate
: prevents destructive or outsized changes (size/scope thresholds).
Every gate emits a 
GateRecord
 (+ witness) into SEG.
13.7 Namespaces, imports, and policies
import policy "policies/security.aclp" as sec
import flow   "flows/spec_and_solve.acl" as s2
policy rewrite {
  on gate_fail(policy|provenance) => quarantine region
  on low_RS or high_UQ            => splice Verifier(rs_boost) before consumer
  on over_budget                  => refactor node shrink=true
  require HITL for merges touching policy shards
}
Imports
 are content-addressed; compiler caches by hash.
Policies
 can be applied per step/shard/pipeline; resolved 
least-privilege
.
13.8 Control flow (bounded)
Fanout/fanin
 for parallelism; 
no unbounded loops
.
Iterative refinement
 is expressed as 
bounded loops
:
flow refine(code_in, max_iter=3) {
  step c0: Critic { inputs: { code: code_in } }
  fanout c0 -> fix[1..max_iter]
  reduce fix[1..max_iter] -> pick using adjudicate=verifier
}
13.9 Memory-native reads & SEG writes
HHNI selectors
 scope retrieval: HHNI:system->section("Auth")->paragraph#3.
Time slicing
 binds reads to ASOF:2025-10-12T00:00:00Z or WINDOW:….
SEG writes
 are append-only facts with temporal validity; 
contradiction
 is an edge, not deletion.
13.10 Compilation & IR mapping
The compiler emits a 
canonical IR
:
{
  "pipeline": "depp.app-blueprint.v3",
  "snapshot": "snap-2025-10-01",
  "shards": [
    {
      "id": "retrieval.sweep",
      "caps": {"max_parallel":64,"token_pool":60000},
      "nodes": [
        {"id":"r0","role":"Retriever","iotype":{"in":["Query","Slice"],"out":["Evidence[]","UQ","Witness"]},"budget":{…},"pins":{…},"policy":"sec_web_readonly"}
      ],
      "edges":[{"from":"r0","to":"r[1..128]","type":"fanout","opts":{"anchors":"super_index"}}]
    }
  ]
}
This IR is the 
source of truth
 for scheduling, replay, and audit.
13.11 Static analyses & lints
Type & kind checking
 across edges.
Budget feasibility
 (sum of min-costs ≤ caps).
Policy reachability
 (no illegal effect paths).
Determinism pins
 present on frontier nodes.
HHNI selector validity
 (no dangling indices).
Gate coverage
 at all boundaries (in/out of shard, before merge).
Lints
 (warnings): oversize prompts, missing UQ emission, fanout without reduce, policy wildcard, etc.
13.12 Runtime semantics (scheduler)
Shard scheduler
: weighted fair-share across shards; local token pools; 
back-pressure
 on overruns.
Retries
: idempotent steps may retry 
with jitter; non-idempotent require policy exception.
Rewrite hooks
: on gate fail/low RS/over-budget invoke 
rewrite controller
 (Chapter 12).
Quarantine/HITL
: risky diffs route to human review with 
ChainDiff
 and 
witness
.
13.13 Security model
Capabilities
 bound per step/shard; default deny.
Data egress
 logged with 
provenance
; redaction policies enforce PII/PHI constraints.
Sandboxing
: tool processes run jailed; network egress by allow-list.

: Budgets enforced; policies applied; gates required.
Determinism
: Pins + snapshot = replayable trace (or 
).
Evolution
: Any change → ChainDiff + parity gates + (if high-risk) HITL.
Outcome.
 ACL makes orchestration 
software-grade
: you can 
read it, diff it, lint it, compile it, replay it
, and explain it to an auditor. It is the language that turns APOE intent into DEPP reality without losing memory, budget, or provenance.
Part V — Verifiable Intelligence: VIF & SEG
Chapter 14. Provenance & Uncertainty (VIF)
Aim.
 Make every artifact 
answerable
: 
who
 produced it (model & tools), 
with what
 (prompts, data slices), 
under which pins
 (versions, seeds), 
with how much uncertainty
 (quantified, calibrated), and 
how to replay it
 (deterministically or with bounded variance).
14.1 VIF metadata — the witness tuple
Definition (witness tuple).
For any produced artifact 
(text, code, table, decision), we attach a 
witness
 
:
actor
: { role, model_id, weights_hash, runtime_hash }
inputs
: { prompt_template_id, prompt_args, hhni_slices[], seg_refs[], tools_used[] }
pins
: { snapshot_id, tool_versions{}, index_versions{}, seed, policy_ids[] }
provenance
: { source_docs[], chunk_locs[], citations[], license_tags[] }
uq
: { method[], scores, bands, calibration, decision: {kappa, gate} }
trace
: { step_id, chain_id, started_at, ended_at, cost, tokens, wall_ms }
Minimal JSON (machine-readable, embeddable):
{
  "actor": {
    "role": "Reasoner",
    "model_id": "gpt-4o",
    "weights_hash": "sha256:3f…c9",
    "runtime_hash": "sha256:rt…aa"
  },
  "inputs": {
    "prompt_template_id": "tpl.claim.v2",
    "prompt_args": {"question":"Summarize OAuth2 threats post-2024"},
    "hhni_slices": ["HHNI:system->section('Security')->paragraph#12"],
    "seg_refs": ["SEG:claims/2025-10-12/oidc"],
    "tools_used": ["web.search@1.9.3","pdf.extract@0.7.1"]
  },
  "pins": {
    "snapshot_id": "snap-2025-10-01",
    "tool_versions": {"web.search":"1.9.3","pdf.extract":"0.7.1"},
    "index_versions": {"hhni:security":"v37"},
    "seed": 101,
    "policy_ids": ["sec_web_readonly","pii_guard_v3"]
  },
  "provenance": {
    "source_docs": [

    ],
    "chunk_locs": [{"doc_id":"doi:…","start":"p.4 ¶2","end":"p.5 ¶1"}],
    "citations": ["[1] …"]
  },
  "uq": {
    "method": ["temp_sweep","self_consistency","ece_postcal"],
    "scores": {"entropy":0.23,"margin":0.61,"var_sc":0.08},

    "tokens": 1842,
    "wall_ms": 8240,
    "cost": {"usd": 0.032}
  }
}
Design rules (VIF-minimal vs VIF-full):
Minimal
 must include: model_id, weights_hash, prompt_template_id, snapshot_id, hhni_slices, at least one uq.score.
Full
 must add tool & index versions, seed, policy_ids, ECE, trace timing & token/costs, and provenance.chunk_locs.
SEG anchoring.
Each witness is written as a 
SEG node
 witness::<uuid> with edges:
(artifact) <-[witnessed_by]- (witness)
(witness) -[derived_from]-> (source_doc::<id>#chunk::<span>)
(witness) -[used_tool]-> (tool::<name>@<ver>)
(witness) -[ran_under]-> (snapshot::<id>)
14.2 UQ methods — computing uncertainty you can trust
We quantify uncertainty along three axes:
Retrieval uncertainty
 
: Is the grounding evidence 
sufficient & consistent
?
Model uncertainty
 
: Is the model 
confident & consistent
 across samples?
Calibration error
 
: Do reported confidences match reality?
14.2.1 Per-step signals
Entropy / margin (single pass).
on class/logit heads (where available).
Margin
 
.
Mapped to 
via min–max per head. Cheap, universal.
Temperature sweep (multi-pass).
Run the same prompt at 
; measure textual dispersion (e.g., pairwise ROUGE-L or embedding distance).
Score: 
.
Self-consistency / ensembles.
independent decodes → majority consensus or agreement rate.
Score: 
.
MC-dropout (when logits exposed).
Sample 
forward passes with dropout; use predictive variance.
Score: 
.
Verifier disagreement.
A second model/role critiques the claim; disagreement lifts uncertainty.
Score: 
.
Retrieval sufficiency.
Evidence coverage: fraction of claim spans aligned to citations.
Cross-doc consistency: contradiction rate among top-k sources.
Score: 
.
Aggregation (bounded risk):
with 
. Defaults: 
.
14.2.2 Calibration
We 
post-calibrate
 the model’s raw confidence 
to a calibrated 
using:
Platt scaling (logistic)
 on a labeled dev set: 
.
Isotonic regression
 when monotonic but non-linear mapping fits better.
ECE/ACE
 (Expected/Adaptive Calibration Error): bucket predictions, compare avg confidence vs empirical accuracy; target 
.
Calibration artifacts are versioned per 
(model_id, domain, prompt_family)
 and pinned in the witness (calibration.calib_id).
14.2.3 κ-abstention policy
Define risk bands after calibration:
Green:
 
→ proceed.
Amber:
 
→ show banner; route Verifier or request user confirmation for high-impact actions.
Red:
 
→ 
abstain
 (
); propose next steps (more evidence, narrower slice, HITL).
ACL example:
gate uq: UQGate { inputs: { uq: r }, policy: "risk_bands_v3" }
14.3 Confidence bands & UI cues
Principles.
 Confidence is 
visible by default
, 
layered
, and 
explainable on click
.
Badge
 on every artifact title: ✓ High confidence / ~ Medium / ! Low.
Color
: green/amber/red, color-blind safe palettes.
Tooltip
: “Why this band?” → show top-3 drivers (e.g., 
low evidence coverage
, 
verifier disagreement
, 
high sample variance
).
Inline citations
: footnotes with doc_id#chunk hover to preview source, highlight aligned spans.
Diff-aware code panes
: risk badge tied to changed hunks; link to tests that justify confidence.
Action gating
: destructive ops (write, deploy, merge) are disabled or require HITL outside green band.
Recommended payload (client contract):
{
  "confidence": {
    "band": "amber",
    "score": 0.47,
    "drivers": [
      {"name":"evidence_coverage","value":0.62},
      {"name":"self_consistency_var","value":0.11},
      {"name":"verifier_disagreement","value":1.0}
    ],
    "suggested_next": [
      "Open verifier report",
      "Add sources for section §2.3",
      "Narrow time window to last 90 days"
    ]
  }
}
Accessibility & UX notes.
Always pair color with text/icon; offer “Why-this-confidence?” explainer modal.
Permit 
pinning
 of a witness view for audits; expose 
copy as JSON
.
14.4 Reproducibility & replays
Replay levels.
Deterministic replay
 (under pins):
Same snapshot_id, seed, prompt_template_id, model_id@weights_hash, tool_versions, index_versions → identical output, or 
abstain
 if upstream pins missing.
Quasi-deterministic replay
 (external calls stubbed):
Record I/O of tools (HTTP responses, file reads) as 
CAS blobs
; replay uses stubs. Drift shows as 
provenance deltas
.
Robustness replay
 (variance bounds):
Re-execute with 
decodes/temps; report mean±std, majority answer, and band stability. Store 
ReplaySet
 witness with set_id.
What must be pinned.
Models: model_id, weights_hash.
Prompts: prompt_template_id@hash, prompt_args.
Data slices: hhni_slices@version, seg_refs@rev.
Tools/indices: {name: version}, 
container digests
.
Environment: OS/driver digests, 
runtime_hash
; GPU type if applicable.
Seeds: seed (global) + per-step overrides.
Failure semantics.
If determinism breaks under pins → emit ACL-D301 Determinism breach, attach a 
diagnostic witness
 that enumerates differing hashes; auto-rollback or mark chain 
tainted
 per policy.
Storage & retention.
Witnesses, stubs, and calibration packs are content-addressed; retention policy defaults:
High-risk pipelines: ≥ 6 months.
PII/PHI: redact at 
ingest
; retain hashed surrogates and selectors only.
Export: acl export seg --bundle=vif+trace produces machine-readable audit packs.
14.5 Putting it together — the gate math and policy
Unified risk score.
with defaults 
.
Gate decision.
if u <= 0.30: pass
elif u <= 0.60:
    pass_with_banner; require Verifier on downstream write/deploy
else:
    abstain(kappa); propose next_steps()
ACL snippet (policy-aware):
gate uq: UQGate {
  inputs: { uq: r }
  policy: risk_bands_v3   // stores thresholds and next-step recipes
  strict: true            // block writes on amber+
}
14.6 Checklists (implementation-ready)
Producer (at every step):
Attach weights_hash, prompt_template_id@hash, seed.
Record hhni_slices and seg_refs used.
Compute at least two 
signals (e.g., entropy + self-consistency).
If RAG, compute 
(coverage & contradictions).
Apply per-model calibration; include ECE.
Emit witness → SEG with edges.
Consumer (gates & UI):
Enforce κ-policy by band; disable destructive actions on amber+.
Show badge + drivers; link to sources with chunk previews.
Offer 
Replay
 (deterministic or robust) when band≠green.
Persist gate record in SEG; surface in audit view.
Outcome.
VIF makes every answer 
provable
, every confidence 
quantified & calibrated
, and every 
run 
replayable
. Together with ACL and HHNI, it upgrades outputs from 
claims
 to 
witnessed evidence
, enabling safe automation, regulatory compliance, and user trust.
Part V — Verifiable Intelligence: VIF & SEG
Chapter 15. Shared Evidence Graph (SEG)
Aim.
 Make 
evidence itself
 a first-class, queryable substrate. The SEG stores claims, sources, tool calls, witnesses, decisions, and their temporal validity so that any output can be traced, sliced “as-of” time, exported for audit, and replayed.

15.1.4 SHACL shapes (conformance)
Claim must have a witness and at least one lineage edge
@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .
@prefix seg: <https://aimos.dev/seg#> .
seg:ClaimShape a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass seg:Claim ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path seg:hasWitness ;
    sh:minCount 1 ;
  ] ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path seg:supports ;
    sh:minCount 1 ;
  ] ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path seg:confidenceBand ;
    sh:in ("green" "amber" "red") ;
  ] .
Witness must pin model & snapshot
seg:WitnessShape a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass seg:Witness ;
  sh:property [ sh:path seg:usesModel ; sh:minCount 1 ] ;
  sh:property [ sh:path seg:ranUnderSnapshot ; sh:minCount 1 ] ;
  sh:property [ sh:path seg:txFrom ; sh:datatype xsd:dateTime ] .
15.2 Temporal graphs & time-slicing
We use 
bi-temporal
 semantics:
Valid time
 (validFrom/validTo): when the statement is intended to hold in the domain.
Transaction time
 (txFrom/txTo): when the record existed in the SEG store.
Rules
Records are 
never hard-deleted
; they are 
ended
 by setting txTo.
Deprecations use 
contradiction edges
 (seg:contradicts) plus optional validTo.
Snapshots
 anchor “as-of” state: a query with asOf=2025-10-12T11:05Z includes nodes with txFrom ≤ asOf < txTo|∞.
Time-slice resolver (pseudo)
function slice(graph, asOf):
  return nodes E where E.txFrom <= asOf and (E.txTo is null or E.txTo > asOf)
Validity join (domain time)
For domain questions (e.g., “what did we believe 
then
?”), filter by both validFrom/validTo and txFrom/txTo.
15.3 Lineage: Claim → Evidence → Decision
Path semantics
A 
valid
 claim must have at least one 
supported path
:
Claim <-hasWitness- Witness -ranUnderSnapshot-> Snapshot
and either
Claim -supports-> Snippet -partOf-> Source 
or
 Claim -derivesFrom-> Artifact|ToolCall.
Path scoring (for audit UX)
Edge weights 
default to 1.0; contradiction edges carry negative influence 
.
Aggregate lineage confidence for a claim:
where 
is the claim’s uncertainty score and 
a logistic squash to 
.
Queries
SPARQL-ish (RDF stores)
SELECT ?claim ?witness ?snippet ?source WHERE {
  ?claim a seg:Claim ;
         seg:hasWitness ?witness ;
         seg:supports ?snippet .
  ?snippet a seg:Snippet ;
           seg:contentAddress ?cas .
  OPTIONAL { ?snippet seg:partOf ?source . }
  FILTER (?asOf >= ?w_txFrom && (bound(?w_txTo) = false || ?asOf < ?w_txTo))
}
Cypher (property graphs like Neo4j)
MATCH (c:Claim)-[:HAS_WITNESS]->(w:Witness),
      (c)-[:SUPPORTS]->(sn:Snippet)
WHERE w.txFrom <= $asOf AND (w.txTo IS NULL OR w.txTo > $asOf)
RETURN c, w, sn
Gremlin (TinkerPop)
g.V().hasLabel('Claim').
  where(out('HAS_WITNESS').has('txFrom', lte(asOf)).
                         or().has('txTo', null).
                              has('txTo', gt(asOf))).
  project('claim','witness','snippet').
    by(id()).
    by(out('HAS_WITNESS').valueMap()).
    by(out('SUPPORTS').valueMap())
UI patterns
Rail view
: left rail is the claim; right rail shows sources/snippets with aligned highlights.
Delta view
: pick any two asOf times to see added/ended edges and changed witnesses.
Decision ladders
: show the exact graph slice that justified a Decision (deploy/merge), including UQ band at the time.
15.4 Export & regulatory packages
Objectives
One-click, machine-readable bundles for auditors/regulators.
Deterministic replay or 
stubbed
 replay of external calls.

  },
  "retention": {
    "policy_id": "ret_high_risk_v2",
    "min_months": 6
  }
}
Signing
Generate manifest.sig as a detached Ed25519 signature over the canonicalized manifest.json and graph.ndjson hashes.
Store public key fingerprint; publish key in your compliance registry.
Privacy & redaction
Redact PII 
at ingest
; SEG holds selectors (e.g., salted hashes) and data class tags.
Export bundles include 
redaction map
 (what was removed & why) for auditors.
EU AI Act mapping (high-risk systems)
Art. 12 (logging):
 graph.ndjson + witnesses/*.json with tx & valid times.
Art. 52 (synthetic labeling):
 Artifact nodes carry seg:modality and synthetic marker; export includes labeling policy.
Retention (≥ 6 months):
 manifest.retention.min_months and store policy id.
Risk management:
 include UQ calibration packs & policy configs in bundle.
15.5 Storage, indexing, and scale
Backends
RDF (e.g., Jena, Neptune-RDF):
 strong JSON-LD/SHACL alignment; native SPARQL/time filters.
Property graphs (Neo4j, Neptune-PG):
 easier path queries & ops dashboards; use custom time-slice middleware.
Hybrid:
 store JSON-LD canonically in object store; mirror into PG for fast lineage UI.
Indexes
Node: (type), (txFrom, txTo), (validFrom, validTo), (contentAddress).
Edge: (src, rel, dst), plus tx* and valid*.
Secondary: (confidenceBand), (uncertaintyScore), (policyId).
Sharding: by snapshot_id or by (project, chain_id) domains.
Throughput tips
Write 
append-only
 batches; end records by setting txTo (no deletes).
Pre-compute 
lineage cones
 (transitive closure summaries) for hot claims.
Cache 
witness packs
 (VIF) by (model_id, prompt_template_id, seed).
15.6 SEG API (read-only)
GET /seg/lineage
Query parameters: root, depth, asOf, include=decisions,snippets,witnesses
Response: DAG slice (nodes+edges) + lineage confidence (LC) + summary counts.
GET /seg/witness/:id
Returns the VIF JSON (Chapter 14 schema) with integrity hashes.
POST /seg/export
Body: { "roots":[…], "depth":3, "asOf":"…", "format":"bundle/v1" }
Returns: signed bundle URL + sha256.
GET /seg/search
Text/metadata search over Claim/Artifact/Source with filters on bands, policies, time.
All endpoints are read-only.
 Mutations happen only through the memory/orchestration pipelines that already emit witnesses and graph deltas.
15.7 Checklists
Producer (pipelines)
Emit JSON-LD nodes/edges for Claim/Artifact/Witness/ToolCall/Snapshot.
Fill both tx* and valid* (if domain time known).
Use content-addressed blobs for sources/snippets & store license tags.
Append contradiction edges rather than deleting outdated claims.
Platform
Enforce SHACL shapes on ingest; reject malformed witnesses.
Maintain time-slice resolver and cache for hot asOf queries.
Provide signed export; keep public keys rotated & pinned.
Monitor lineage LC drift and band distributions over time.
UX
Always show “as-of” clock for views.
One-click: 
Show lineage
, 
Compare times
, 
Export bundle
.
Inline highlights for cited snippets with CAS previews.
15.8 Outcome
The SEG turns “because the model said so” into 
because the evidence shows so
. With JSON-LD/SHACL for structure, bi-temporal slicing for truth-over-time, lineage scoring for audits, and signed export packs for regulators, AIMOS/APOE upgrades outputs into 
durable, inspectable facts
 that can be replayed, defended, and improved.
Part VI — Atomic Evolution: SDF-CVF
Chapter 16. Atomic Commits Across Code/Docs/Tags/Traces
Aim.
 Make 
every
 change travel as one sealed unit across the quartet {code, docs, tags, traces}—gated, witnessed, reversible.
16.0 Core model
ChangeSet Δ
 — the atomic proposal spanning all artifacts.
Gates G
 — deterministic checks that 
bind
 the quartet.
Outcomes
 — PASS → merge; SOFT_FAIL → auto-fix then re-gate; HARD_FAIL → quarantine; DEFER → HITL.
Snapshots
 — every PASS produces:
S_code, S_docs, S_tags (HHNI delta), S_traces (SEG delta) → rolled up into 
Snapshot S*
 used for replay/rollback.
Formal.
 A commit K = (Δ, S*, W) is valid iff 
∀
 g 
∈
 G: g(
Δ
) = PASS and a Witness W (VIF) is attached.

16.2 Parity across the quartet
Diff semantics
Code:
 AST-level semantic diffs (noise-free), API surface map.
Docs/Specs:
 schema-aware diffs (headings, tables, OpenAPI).
Tags (HHNI):
 node/edge deltas + DD (dependency delta) + impact cone.
Traces (SEG):
 graph deltas (nodes/edges) with bi-temporal fields.
Parity rules
Spec→Code:
 Any public contract change must have corresponding code diffs and tests (create stubs if missing).
Code→Docs:
 Public surface changes must update docs (autofill allowed but flagged).
Code↔Telemetry:
 Added behaviors must bind to observable metrics/logs.
Memory tags:
 New concepts introduce HHNI atoms with priority vectors; cross-links hashed; high-impact edits require preview.
ADR & branching strategy
ADR on change intent.
 Each Δ starts with an ADR (motivation, options, decision, consequences) → stored in SEG and linked to the commit.
Branching.
 Trunk-based; short-lived feature branches. High-risk branches run with 
capability tokens
 (restricted tools/data).
Merge protocol.
 All gates green + (if R≥τ) dual reviewer sign-off (two-key) + signed snapshot.
ADR minimal template:
ADR-####: Title
Context
Decision
Alternatives
Consequences (tech/risk)
Links (SEG ids, issues)
16.3 Auto-fix, quarantine, rollback
Auto-fixers (non-interactive)
Docs/spec parity:
 generate or update missing sections; fix OpenAPI/JSON-Schema drift.
Tests:
 synthesize unit tests for uncovered public methods; strengthen weak assertions.
Memory:
 reindex HHNI; regenerate dependency hashes; prune low-weight edges.
Provenance:
 replay tool calls under frozen snapshot; regenerate witness with pinned seeds.
Perf/Cost:
 apply prompt compression (dumbbell layout), cache hot sub-plans, lower temperature for stability.
Quarantine
Isolation.
 Move Δ to a 
quarantine branch
 with read-only memory; run in sandboxed containers; redact secrets.
Diagnostics.
 Attach gate failure reasons, impact cone, suggested fixes; open a tracked 
Quarantine Incident (QI)
 with SLA.
Exit.
 On green re-gating → return to normal merge; else 
auto-revert
 if SLA exceeded.
Rollback
Design.
 Two-phase merge with snapshot publication:
Prepare S* (code/docs/tags/traces) and publish to the snapshot log.
Flip routing to S* for live reads/writes.
Revert.
 rollback(to=S_prev) atomically resets routing pointers; append contradiction edges in SEG (do not delete); rehydrate HHNI from S_prev.
Saga/compensation.
 For side-effects across stores, maintain compensators (e.g., reverse data migrations, retract tool outputs).
Rollback API (sketch)
POST /evolution/rollback
{
  "to_snapshot": "snap-2025-10-12T11:02:22Z",
  "reason": "gate-regression-coverage",
  "requester": "release-bot",
  "two_key": ["ownerA","ownerB"]
}
16.4 DORA-aligned metrics & SLOs
Track per repo/program:
Deployment frequency
 — merges to trunk with PASS.
Lead time for changes
 — ADR→merge.
Change failure rate (CFR)
 — fraction of merges that trigger rollback/quarantine within T hours. 
Target:
 <10%.
MTTR
 — mean time from quarantine/incident open → green re-gate or rollback. 
Target:
 P50 < 4h, P95 < 24h.
Parity score
 — % commits where quartet diffs are mutually consistent (no autofix needed). 
Target:
 >90%.
Coverage deltas
 — Δ line/branch coverage; 
Mutation score
 on touched code.
Budget adherence
 — token/latency deltas vs. budgets.
Emissions
Every gate emits: {gate, verdict, reason, patch?, duration, owner, risk, κ_band} → OpenTelemetry spans with snapshot id → SEG Decision nodes for audit.
16.5 Checklists
Before merge (bot-enforced)
All gates PASS (or SOFT_FIX applied + re-gate PASS)
Witness bundle attached (model hash, prompt template, tools)
ADR linked; risk R computed; two-key approvals if R≥τ
Snapshot S* prepared & signed; exportable pack green (SEG/JSON-LD)
If quarantine
QI opened with SLA & owner
Capability tokens restricted; secrets rotated if needed
Autofixers attempted; re-gate result posted
Exit: merge or rollback executed & witnessed
If rollback
Routing flipped to S_prev atomically
SEG contradiction edges emitted; user-facing label set (amber/red)
Post-incident ADR addendum with root cause and follow-ups
16.6 Outcome
SDF-CVF turns “updates” into 
governed evolution
: the same commit updates code, specifies what changed, tags the memory, and records witnessable traces. Gates keep the quartet glued; quarantine contains risk; rollback is a 
first-class, witnessed
 operation—not a scramble.
Part VI — Atomic Evolution: SDF-CVF
Chapter 17. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) — risk scoring, two-key approval, review UX, accountability
Aim.
 Insert 
governed human judgment
 at precisely the points where automation is most likely to err or cause harm—without turning HITL into a bottleneck. Every intervention is measurable, reproducible, minimally-intrusive, and leaves a cryptographically verifiable trail.
17.0 Control surfaces
When:
 pre-merge, pre-deploy, post-incident, post-training-data change, high-impact memory edits (high DD), policy-touching changes (PII/licensing).
Where:
 SDF-CVF gate line (Ch.16), APOE plan boundaries (Ch.11), SEG decision issuance (Ch.15).
Who:
 role-separated 
Proposer
 (author), 
Reviewer-A
 (domain), 
Reviewer-B
 (risk/compliance), 
Operator
 (release).
17.1 Risk scoring (R)
A single bounded risk score drives HITL policy.
Signal model.
 For a candidate change/answer x:
κ_band — abstention/uncertainty band from UQ (Ch.14): entropy, variance, ECE-adjusted.
I — 
impact
: blast radius (users, data domains), monetary/latency deltas, dependency cone size.
N — 
novelty
: distance from prior patterns (embedding drift, unseen API surface, unseen spec pattern).
P — 
privacy/policy exposure
: PII flows, license changes, policy pack hits.
D — 
data-lineage risk
: weak/unknown source provenance in SEG, contradiction edges involved.
S — 
safety
: prompt-injection exposure, tool capability delta, sandbox escape potential.
Weights {w_*} are program-specific; all components normalized to [0,1].
Thresholds.
R < τ₀ → 
auto
 (no human).
τ₀ ≤ R < τ₁ → 
single-review
 (Reviewer-A).
R ≥ τ₁ → 
two-key approval
 (Reviewer-A + Reviewer-B).
R ≥ τ_block → 
block + quarantine
 (Ch.16).
Calibration.
 Weekly backtests correlate R to downstream incidents/rollbacks; optimize {w_*}, τ for target CFR and MTTR (Ch.16.4).
17.2 Two-key approval (2KA)
Principle.
 No single human can push a high-risk decision. Keys are 
role-separated
 and 
non-delegable
.
Policy.
Distinct org roles: 
Domain Owner
 (Key-A), 
Risk/Compliance Owner
 (Key-B).
Cooling period: approvals must be non-simultaneous (e.g., ≥ 10 min apart) unless incident emergency label is set.
Conflict checks: reviewers cannot approve their own proposals; no reciprocal approvals within a rolling window.
Mechanics.
Detached approval objects
 signed with FIDO2 or org PKI:
Approval {
  id, snapshot_id, risk: R, gate_results, diffs, reviewer_id, role,
  decision: {APPROVE|REJECT|REQUEST_CHANGES},
  statement, signatures: [sig(reviewer_key)]
}
Threshold signature
 (t=2 of n) yields a single merge token bound to snapshot_id and risk hash.
Expiry
: merge token TTL (e.g., 24h); any material change invalidates token (content-addressed diffs).
Emergency break-glass.
Requires three distinct keys (incl. Operator) + incident ticket.
Auto-opens post-mortem ADR and sets amber label in SEG; time-boxed.
17.3 Review UX & diff semantics
Reviewer view (single pane).
Risk card
: R, source breakdown, thresholds, suggested path.
Quartet diffs
 (noise-free):
Code: AST/API surface, mutation-score delta.
Docs/specs: schema-aware diffs, OpenAPI/JSON-Schema checks.
Tags (HHNI): node/edge delta, DD, impact cone preview.
Traces (SEG): claim/evidence/decision changes, contradiction edges.
Witness panel
 (VIF): model id & weights hash, prompt template, tool calls, seeds, snapshot id.
UQ panel
: κ-band, ECE, variance; links to calibration run.
Playback
: one-click 
replay under snapshot
 in a sandbox; preview env for web apps.
Policy hits
: PII/secret taint paths, license diffs, guardrail triggers.
Actions
: Approve/Reject/Request changes; add constraints; assign follow-ups.
Diff semantics.
Collapse trivial churn (format, comments).
Group related hunks by API/feature.
Show 
dependency impact
: predicted blast radius across HHNI/SEG.
Commenting.
 Threaded comments are first-class SEG annotations (time-sliced), not ephemeral chat.
17.4 Accountability trails
Non-repudiation.
 Every decision writes a 
Decision
 node into SEG with:
reviewer ids (pseudonymous ids allowed in export), role, timestamp,
approval object hash + signatures,
linkage to Snapshot S*, gate results, and risk factors.
Temporality.
 All review artifacts carry [t_from, t_to); replays are 
as-of
 time-slice correct.
Chain-of-custody.
 proposal → gates → reviews → merge/rollback is a single, queryable lineage chain (Ch.15).
Access.
 Reviews are immutable; corrections append contradiction edges + addenda. No destructive edits.
17.5 HITL workflow (happy path & deviations)
Happy path.
Proposer opens Δ with ADR; SDF-CVF gates run.
Risk engine computes R, emits policy target (auto/single/2KA).
Reviewers receive a 
frozen preview
 bound to S*.
Reviewers approve; threshold sig creates merge token.
Release bot verifies token → merges & publishes S*.
SEG gains Decision node; VIF witness bundle archived.
Deviations.
Request changes
 → Proposer updates Δ → gates re-run → new S* invalidates old token.
Reject
 → Δ quarantined (Ch.16.3).
Timeout
 → auto-close or escalate per SLA; optionally re-risk with stricter thresholds.
17.6 APIs (sketch)
POST /hitl/risk/score → {R, factors, thresholds}
POST /hitl/review/open → returns review_id, snapshot_id
POST /hitl/review/{id}/decision → stores signed decision
POST /hitl/merge-token → threshold-sign → token (bound to snapshot_id, risk_hash)
POST /hitl/replay → run under snapshot; attach artifacts to SEG
GET /hitl/audit/{snapshot_id} → full lineage trail (read-only)
All endpoints read-only except 
decisions
; merges executed by release bot only with valid token.
17.7 Metrics & SLOs
Review lead time
: t(decision) − t(open). Targets: P50 < 60m, P95 < 24h.
Human load
: reviews per reviewer/day; auto-balance routing.
True-positive HITL
: fraction of high-R that prevented a later rollback/incident.
False-positive HITL
: low-value interventions (optimize thresholds/weights).
Coverage
: % of merges at each band (auto/single/2KA).
Drift
: delta in reviewer decisions vs. model κ-band; recalibrate UQ monthly.
All metrics emitted as OpenTelemetry spans, linked to SEG.
17.8 Edge cases & safeguards
Prompt-injection suspected
 → force full redaction view; require 2KA regardless of R.
Training data touch
 → always 2KA + dataset snapshot witness.
Memory high-impact (DD ≥ θ_DD)
 → require impact preview acknowledgment + 2KA.
Cross-repo changes
 → composite review with per-repo owners; composite threshold signature.
Reviewer unavailability
 → escalation ladders; never collapse 2KA to single key.
17.9 Minimal data schemas
Review (SEG JSON-LD fragment).

}
17.10 Security & privacy
Signer hygiene:
 hardware-backed keys; rotation and revocation; approval key use is least-privilege and auditable.
PII minimization:
 review UI shows 
projections
, not raw payloads; deep-link to redacted diffs.
Replay sandboxes:
 network egress deny by default; capability tokens for tools.
Tamper-evidence:
 all review objects and merges are content-addressed; SEG stores hashes.
17.11 Outcome
HITL in AIMOS/APOE is 
surgical, not theatrical
: 
measured risk → minimal human intervention → maximal accountability
. Two-key approval prevents single-point failure; the review UX compresses complex parity checks into a legible decision; the evidence graph guarantees the story of “who decided what, based on which facts” is never lost.
Part VII — IDE-in-the-Loop: From Prompt to Running App
Chapter 18. Blueprint → Scaffold → Code → Test → Deploy → Observe
Aim.
 Turn 
intent
 into 
software
 with auditability. APOE compiles the blueprint into a governed plan; SDF-CVF enforces parity; VIF/SEG preserve lineage; CMC/HHNI ensures the system remembers what it built and why.
18.0 System overview
Lifecycle (governed loop).
Blueprint
 (spec as data) →
Scaffold
 (deterministic repo, env, policies) →
Code
 (intent-constrained synthesis + refactors) →
Test
 (pyramid + mutation + property) →
Deploy
 (ephemeral → canary → prod) →
Observe
 (telemetry → SEG → feedback into memory)
Traceability rule.
 Every transition emits: (snapshot_id, plan_id, gate results, UQ vector, provenance) into SEG; code/docs/tags/traces co-evolve in one atomic commit (SDF-CVF).
18.1 Blueprint YAML — the contract APOE compiles
A 
machine-readable spec
 that binds scope, constraints, budgets, and acceptance. Minimal yet complete.
Schema (v0).
blueprint:
  id: "shop-web-v1"
  version: "0.1.0"
  intent:
    problem: "Sell digital goods globally"
    outcomes:

            then:  "p95 page load < 1.2s"

Determinism.
 Blueprint → plan hash → 
content-addressed
 scaffolds; rebuilds are byte-for-byte under same snapshot & toolchain.
18.2 Scaffolding strategies — from empty repo to governed workspace
Goals.
 Deterministic structure, policy-first wiring, fast feedback.
Outputs.
Monorepo (e.g., /apps/web, /services/api, /packages/ui, /infra).
Locked toolchain: tooling.lock (node/go/python versions, formatters, linters).
Policy packs pre-wired: PII redaction, license allowlist, secret scanners.
CI templates: build → test → preview → canary → promote.
SEG seed
: initial evidence graph nodes (Spec, Contracts, SLOs).
Scaffolding modes.
Greenfield (deterministic).
Template catalog selection bound to blueprint.domains.
Generate from commit-pinned templates; write 
Scaffold Witness
:
scaffold_witness.json = { template_ids, commit_hashes, toolchain, blueprint_hash, snapshot_id }
Gates: g_template_integrity, g_policy_boot.
Brownfield (delta-aware).
AST inventory + dependency graph → 
Delta Scaffold
 only for missing contracts/tests/policies.
Gates: g_drift_report (lists divergences spec↔code), g_delta_conflicts.
Failure modes & mitigations.
Toolchain drift
 → pin & cache; reproduce via tooling.lock.
Policy pack gaps
 → block merge if required pack missing (licenses, PII).
Template entropy
 → signatures on templates; SEG records hashes.
18.3 Code — intent-constrained synthesis and safe refactors
Principle.
 The builder agent writes 
within
 constraints, not from scratch; codegen is 
review-ready
 (tests/docs/traces).
Loop (per module).
Retrieve
 (CMC/HHNI): similar patterns, past ADRs, contract snippets.
Plan
 (APOE step): outline files, functions, interfaces; set budgets.
Synthesize
 (ICS): generate minimal viable implementation 
constrained by
 contracts, types, budget.
Refine
: static analysis (types, lints), security scan, small refactors.
Emit artifacts
: code + docstrings + SEG snippets + tags (HHNI).
Gate
: compile, unit tests, mutation score, coverage.
Intent-Constrained Synthesis (ICS) rulebook.
Never bypass contracts; treat OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas as types.
Prefer composition over global state; enforce dependency boundaries.
Generate tests 
with
 code; failing tests abort synthesis.
Every public surface is documented; docstrings reference blueprint acceptance.
Refactors (safe by construction).
Spec-led refactor
: change contract → run codemods → re-generate adapters → rerun tests.
Performance refactor
: CI-guarded; requires baseline & regression gates.
Security refactor
: must pass policy pack scanners; link to threat model item.
UQ for code steps.
 Emit κ-band over synthesis confidence (n-best programs agreement, static checker entropy). Low κ → require reviewer attention (HITL).
18.4 Test — the pyramid and its gates
Layers & targets.
Unit
 (fast, many): functions/components; target P50 < 200 ms/test; coverage ≥ 80%.
Contract
: provider/consumer checks from OpenAPI/GraphQL; 
blocking
.
Integration
: DB, queues, third-party fakes; P95 suite < 5 min.
E2E
: user flows from blueprint; run on preview env; flake budget < 2%.
Advanced checks.
Mutation testing
 (change-failure detector): score ≥ 70% to merge.
Property-based
 (invariants), 
fuzz
 for parsers/APIs.
Security tests
: taint flows (PII), authz matrices, prompt-injection scenarios.
Gates (SDF-CVF).
g_tests (pass), g_cov (thresholds), g_mutation, g_contract, g_security.
Any failure → 
quarantine branch
 and proposed autofix or ADR for defer.
Evidence.
 Test runs write structured results into SEG: inputs, env hash, artifacts, seeds → full replayability.
18.5 Deploy — previews, canaries, promotion, and telemetry
Pipeline.
Preview env
 per PR (isolated DB + secrets broker).
Attach human playback to proposal (HITL can run flows).
Capture RUM + API traces for 
real user flows
 defined in blueprint.
Canary
 (e.g., 5–10% traffic).
SLO guards from blueprint: if api_p95_ms > 250 or error_rate > 0.5% for N minutes → auto-rollback.
SEG records canary stats as 
Decision supports
 for promotion.
Promotion
 (progressive delivery).
Two-key approval if risk band high (Ch.17); attach decision node to SEG.
Observability wiring (deterministic).
OpenTelemetry auto-injected in services; trace attributes include plan_id, snapshot_id, module, version.
Metrics bundles: latency histograms, error rates, resource use; dashboards are generated from blueprint SLOs.
Anomaly → Memory.
 Significant incidents create atoms in CMC, tagged to modules and causes; future APOE plans retrieve these.
Rollback.
 Content-addressed release; 
one-click reversion
 to last good snapshot_id. SEG adds contradiction edges for the reverted decision.
18.6 Parity enforcement (spec ↔ code)
Parity score
 P 
∈
 [0,1] per module:
API drift
: % of surfaces where code != contract.
Schema drift
: DB vs. declared schema delta.
Doc gap
: exported types without docs.
Trace gap
: live spans missing blueprint labels.
Mechanisms.
AST-level conformance checks (code ↔ OpenAPI/GraphQL).
DB schema diff vs. schema.prisma/DDL; migrations generated or blocked.
Docstring enforcement & spec anchors (IDs from blueprint).
Runtime probes compare emitted traces to blueprint route table.
Gates.
 g_parity_min (e.g., P ≥ 0.93) is 
blocking
; below threshold → auto-generate patches or open ADR with risk score.
Lineage.
 For each parity check, VIF attaches:
tool versions, model IDs/hashes, prompt template IDs,
inputs (spec excerpts), outputs (diffs), κ/UQ,
the 
exact
 snapshot that produced the verdict.
18.7 APOE plan skeleton (ACL example)
pipeline web_shop_build
  using budgets { tokens: 16000, walltime: "45m" }
step plan_from_blueprint
  in  { blueprint_yaml }
  out { plan_json, spec_refs[] }
  tool "apoe.planner"
  gate { g_spec_refs }
step scaffold_monorepo
  in  { plan_json }
  out { repo_path, scaffold_witness }
  tool "scaffold.engine"
  gate { g_template_integrity, g_policy_boot }
step synthesize_modules
  foreach module in plan_json.modules
    in  { repo_path, module, spec_refs }
    out { pr_branch, code_artifacts[] }
    tool "builder.agent"
    budget { tokens: 4096, walltime: "8m" }
    gate { g_compile, g_unit, g_contract }
step run_tests
  in  { pr_branch }
  out { test_report }
  tool "ci.runner"
  gate { g_cov(>=0.80), g_mutation(>=0.70), g_security }
step deploy_preview
  in  { pr_branch }
  out { preview_url, telemetry_pack }
  tool "deploy.preview"
  gate { g_ops_preview }
step canary_and_promote
  in  { release_candidate }
  out { release_id }
  tool "deploy.canary"
  gate { g_canary_slo, g_parity_min, hitl(two_key_if R>=τ1) }
end
18.8 KPIs & SLOs (engineering truth)
Plan determinism
: identical plan hash under same blueprint/toolchain (target 100%).
Time-to-scaffold
: P95 < 90 s; 
time-to-first-preview
: P95 < 15 min.
Change-failure rate (CFR)
 after promotion: < 10%.
Mean-time-to-restore (MTTR)
 with rollback: P50 < 10 min.
Parity score
 P ≥ 0.93 at merge; P ≥ 0.97 within 24 h.
Coverage
: unit ≥ 80%, contract 100% of public surfaces, mutation ≥ 70%.
Telemetry completeness
: traces with valid plan_id ≥ 99%.
All emitted as OpenTelemetry spans with SEG links.
18.9 Failure modes & design countermeasures
Spec/code drift
 → parity gates + codemods; block on severe drift.
Template rot
 → content-addressed templates; signature checks; periodic re-bakes.
Hallucinated code
 → ICS constraints; UQ κ-bands; reviewer prompts on low agreement.
Canary blindness
 → blueprint SLOs are 
blocking guards
; promotion requires healthy evidence in SEG.
Preview flakiness
 → isolate dependencies; seed data snapshots; determinize seeds.
18.10 What’s unlocked
By binding 
APOE
 (compiled reasoning), 
SDF-CVF
 (atomic evolution), 
VIF/SEG
 (lineage), and 
CMC/HHNI
 (memorable context) 
inside the IDE loop
, AIMOS/APOE turns prompts into 
governed software
. Every file, test, deploy, and metric is explainable, replayable, and reversible—
on demand
.
Part VII — IDE-in-the-Loop: From Prompt to Running App
Chapter 19. Templates & Components — Canonical stacks, policy packs, integrations, and cost/energy budgets
Aim.
 Provide 
golden paths
 that APOE can compile deterministically from a blueprint into living repositories, with built-in safety, parity, and observability. Each template is 
content-addressed
, 
policy-pinned
, and emits 
VIF/SEG
 evidence on every step.
19.0 Scope & Principles
Determinism over fashion.
 Pin frameworks, toolchains, and template hashes; all outputs are replayable from the same snapshot.
Policy-first scaffolds.
 Security, compliance, and provenance are baked in, not added later.
Parsimony.
 Few curated stacks, deeply instrumented. Extensions ride plug-in seams, not forks.
SDF-CVF parity.
 Code, docs, tags, and traces co-evolve under the same commit gate.
19.1 Canonical UI Stack (Web)
Stack (pinned).
Runtime: 
Next.js (App Router)
 + 
React
; SSR/ISR enabled.
Styling: 
TailwindCSS
 + 
Radix Primitives
 + 
shadcn/ui
 (accessibility first).
State: 
Zustand
 (local) + 
TanStack Query
 (server data).
i18n & a11y: next-intl, Axe checks in CI.
Testing: 
Vitest
 (unit), 
Playwright
 (E2E), 
Lighthouse CI
 (budgets).
Telemetry: 
web-vitals
 → OpenTelemetry bridge (LCP, CLS, INP tagged with plan_id, snapshot_id).
Scaffold layout.
apps/web/
  app/ (routes, server components)
  components/ (a11y wrapped UI)
  lib/ (fetchers, schema zod)
  public/
  tests/ (unit, e2e)
  .lighthouseci/ (budgets.json)
Gates (blocking).
g_a11y: Axe violations = 0 (severity ≥ serious).
g_perf_web: Lighthouse budgets (LCP ≤ 2.5s P75, CLS ≤ 0.1).
g_contract_ui: Type-safe API clients (OpenAPI/GraphQL codegen) present for each declared endpoint.
g_i18n: Missing translation keys = 0 for required locales.
Evidence.
 Page-level SEG spans include: route, hydration time, data source IDs, blueprint flow ID.
19.2 Canonical API Stack (Service)
REST (default).
Framework: 
FastAPI
 (Python) 
or
 
NestJS
 (TypeScript) — one chosen per program.
Contracts: 
OpenAPI v3
 single source of truth; code generated clients/servers.
Cross-cutting: 
Rate-limit
 (token bucket), 
idempotency keys
 for POST, structured errors (problem-json).
Storage: 
PostgreSQL
 via 
Prisma
 (TS) or 
SQLModel
 (Py); 
pgvector
 if embeddings needed.
Telemetry: OpenTelemetry auto-instrumented; request spans carry 
caller
, 
subject
, 
plan_id
.
GraphQL (optional).
Server: 
Apollo
/
Helix
 with persisted ops and automatic persisted queries (APQ).
Policies: depth/complexity limits, field-level auth resolvers, DataLoader for N+1 control.
Gates (blocking).
g_openapi_valid: spec validates; diff against previous snapshot reviewed.
g_idempotency: endpoints labeled idempotent prove behavior in tests.
g_perf_api: p95 latency ≤ blueprint SLO per route in preview canary.
g_contract_tests: consumer/provider pact tests pass.
19.3 Canonical Auth & Identity
Model.
Protocol: 
OIDC/OAuth2 (PKCE)
 for users; 
mTLS + JWT
 for service-to-service.
Provider: 
Keycloak
 (self-host) or managed (Auth0/Cognito) — template pins one.
Sessions: short-lived access tokens, rotating refresh, token binding on device.
Authorization: 
OPA/Rego
 or 
Cedar
 policies; resource-scoped claims; deny-by-default.
Security primitives (enforced).
Web: SameSite=strict cookies, CSP with nonce, Origin checks for POST.
API: JTI replay cache, aud/iss validation, per-scope rate limits.
Secrets: sealed by KMS; no plaintext in env; CI retrieves via short-lived tokens.
Gates (blocking).
g_auth_lat: p95 login < 400ms in target regions.
g_policy_eval: policy pack validation on all protected routes (OPA unit tests).
g_secret_leak: zero findings from secret scanners; SBOM free of banned licenses.
19.4 Canonical Data Stack
Transactional.
PostgreSQL 15+
 with 
pgcrypto
 + 
RLS
.
Schema: 
Prisma
/
Liquibase
 migrations; content-addressed migration files.
CDC: 
Debezium
 → event bus (for analytics/ELT or sagas).
Analytical.
Warehouse: 
BigQuery
/
Snowflake
 (program-choice).
ETL: 
dbt
 models; lineage exported to SEG (model ↔ query ↔ decision).
Vector & Evidence.
pgvector
 (co-located embeddings) for small/mid; external vector store optional.
SEG store
: RDF/JSON-LD in 
Neptune/Neptune-like
 or 
Neo4j
 with time-slicing.
Gates.
g_rls_required: tables with PII must have RLS ON; tests verify denial by default.
g_migrations_reversible: up/down integrity; destructive ops gated by HITL.
g_data_retention: retention policies match blueprint jurisdiction; verify in CI.
19.5 Template Catalog (Golden Paths)
Repository skeleton (monorepo).

Template witnesses.
template.lock.json records: template IDs, commit hashes, toolchain versions, blueprint hash, and 
snapshot_id
. Any deviation → g_template_integrity fails.
19.6 Policy Packs (snap-in compliance)
Pack
What it enforces
Gates
Security-Basics
TLS, HSTS, CSP, dependency vulns (SLSA/SBOM)
g_csp, g_slsa, g_vuln_budget
PII & Residency
PII taxonomy, field-level redaction, region-pinned storage
g_pii_map, g_residency, g_rls_required
Open-Source Licenses
Allowlist (MIT/Apache/BSD), deny GPL-copyleft by default
g_license_allow
Secrets & Keys
No plaintext secrets; KMS usage; rotation schedule
g_secret_leak, g_key_rotation
Prompt Safety
Injection filters, tool-capability tokens, output watermarking
g_prompt_guard, g_synth_label
LLMOps Logging
VIF minimums (model ID, weights hash, prompt template)
g_vif_min
Retention & Right-to-Forget
Time-boxed logs; SEG export redaction hooks
g_retention, g_rtbf_hooks
Packs are 
declarative bundles
 (rules + scanners + CI jobs). APOE attaches packs from the blueprint, then scaffolds their enforcement points.
19.7 Integration Patterns (Ports & Adapters)
Patterns.
Outbound adapters
 (HTTP/gRPC SDKs): generated from contracts; all calls go through 
Capability Tokens
 (scoped, expiring).
Inbound webhooks
: signature verification (HMAC/Ed25519), idempotency, replay protection.
Events & Sagas
: outbox pattern with transactional writes; retries with DLQ and observability tags.
RAG connectors
: retrieval adapters (files, DBs, wikis) with 
VIF capture
 (source URI, digest, access policy).
Streaming
: Server-Sent Events or WebSockets gated by policy pack; redact on the fly if PII.
ACL example — adding a payment provider.
step integrate_payments
  in  { openapi_spec:"providers/stripe.yaml" }
  out { sdk_pkg, provider_adapter, contract_tests }
  tool "contract.codegen"
  gate { g_openapi_valid, g_license_allow }
step secure_webhooks
  in  { provider_adapter }
  out { webhook_handler }
  tool "adapter.scaffold"
  policy { signatures:"ed25519", idempotency:true, retry: "expo<5x" }
  gate { g_webhook_sig, g_idempotency, g_observe_spans }
19.8 Cost & Energy Budgets (governed spend)
Budget classes.
Tokens
 (LLM/RAG): input/output tokens per step/plan.
Compute
: CPU/GPU minutes for CI, inference, training.
Storage
: GB-months for DB/object/SEG/vector.
Network
: egress GB, third-party API calls.
Energy/Carbon
: kWh and CO₂e per stage.
Budget DSL (embedded in blueprint).
budgets:
  tokens:
    per_call: 16000
    per_plan: 1.2e6
  compute:
    ci_minutes: 60
    gpu_hours: 0
  storage_gb_month:
    hot: 50
    cold: 200
  network_gb: 100
  energy:
    kwh_month: 45
    co2e_tonnes_max: 0.02
Estimation formulas.
Token cost
: C_tokens = Σ (rate_model_i * tokens_i)
Compute
: C_compute = Σ (rate_cpu*h_cpu + rate_gpu*h_gpu)
Storage
: C_storage = Σ (rate_tier_gb * GB_month)
Energy
: kWh = Σ (power_W / 1000 * hours), CO₂e = kWh * grid_intensity_kg_per_kWh / 1000
Gates.
g_cost_plan: projected plan cost ≤ budget (fail fast pre-run).
g_cost_actual: actual cost within ×(1+ε) of projection (ε default 10%).
g_energy: kWh & CO₂e under thresholds; if not, trigger 
optimize-or-abstain
 step.
Optimization levers.
Prompt compaction (HHNI dumbbell compression).
Cache hits (retrieval/page cache) and 
vector co-location
 (pgvector).
Lower-rate regions for CI; canary duration caps; adaptive sampling for telemetry.
19.9 Golden Paths & Extension Points
Golden paths (opinionated defaults).
Web
: Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn → Playwright + Lighthouse.
API
: NestJS + OpenAPI + Prisma + Postgres (pgvector optional).
Auth
: OIDC (PKCE) + OPA policies.
Data
: Postgres + dbt + Warehouse; CDC → event bus.
Observability
: OpenTelemetry → SEG links everywhere.
Extension points (guarded).
Swap REST↔GraphQL behind 
contract equivalence
 gate.
Plug alternative vector stores behind 
RAG Adapter
 interface.
Add GPU inference workers under 
energy/cost
 budget gates.
19.10 KPIs & SLOs
UI
: LCP P75 ≤ 2.5s, CLS P75 ≤ 0.1, INP P75 ≤ 200ms.
API
: p95 latency ≤ blueprint target; error rate ≤ 0.5%.
Auth
: login p95 ≤ 400ms; token issuance failure < 0.1%.
Data
: migration success 100% in preview; rollback P50 < 2 min.
Cost
: variance to projection ≤ 10%; 
Energy
: kWh within budget.
Evidence
: ≥ 99% spans tagged with plan_id & snapshot_id.
All KPIs are exported as metrics + SEG nodes with time windows (for audit packs).
19.11 Failure Modes & Countermeasures

19.12 What this unlocks
A 
disciplined, repeatable
 path from blueprint to production where 
every component
—UI, API, Auth, Data—arrives with 
guardrails, gates, and evidence
 already wired. APOE no longer “generates code”; it 
installs a governed system
 whose cost, energy, and risk are explicitly budgeted and continuously proven in the 
Shared Evidence Graph
.
Part VIII — Security, Safety, & Compliance
Chapter 20. Threat Model & Guardrails — injection/exfiltration/SSRF patterns, tool sandboxes, capability tokens, DP/redaction, abstention/containment
Aim.
 Define a 
practical, enforceable
 threat model for AIMOS/APOE and install 
guardrails-as-code
 that hold under real workloads: RAG, agents, tools, IDE-in-the-loop. Every control emits 
witnesses (VIF)
 and connects to the 
Shared Evidence Graph (SEG)
 so we can prove what the system did, why, and under which risk posture.
20.0 Security doctrine (tl;dr)
Deny by default.
 Capabilities are 
requested
 and 
granted
 with scope, duration, and rate.
Untrusted by construction.
 All user/content/context is tainted until proven otherwise.
Plan before power.
 ACL/APOE plans are statically checked; high-risk steps require HITL (Ch.17).
Degrade safely.
 When in doubt, 
abstain
 (κ-gating) or 
contain
 (least-privilege sandbox), not “best-guess.”
20.1 Threat model for agentic systems
We profile threats by 
surface
 and 
goal
. Each entry lists typical attacks 
➜
 symptoms 
➜
 controls.
20.1.1 Prompt- & context-level threats
Vectors.
 Classic prompt injection (direct/indirect), instruction smuggling in HTML/Markdown/CSV/ALT text, jailbreak patterns, overlong-context poisoning, retrieval booby-traps (“ignore previous; exfiltrate X”).
Symptoms.
 Role leakage; tool misuse; non-deterministic replies; policy bypass in 
citations.
Controls.
Role isolation:
 system vs. user vs. tool prompts are 
separately hashed
 and stored; only system prompt may set policy.
Quoted-content boxing:
 untrusted text is wrapped with 
verbatim fences + provenance tags
 and 
never
 executed as instruction.
Policy-prefix pinning:
 a signed policy prelude (template hash + SEG id) precedes all chains.
Detector ensemble:
 pattern + LM-based detectors score “instructionality,” HTML/script payloads, and known jailbreaks; raise κ or strip.
20.1.2 Tooling & RAG threats
Vectors.
 Over-permissive tools, TOCTOU races, SSRF via URL tools, unlimited file I/O, secret leakage from vector stores, prompt injection through retrieved docs.
Symptoms.
 Calls to arbitrary hosts, filesystem traversal, credentials in responses, “phantom” tool execs.
Controls.
Capability tokens (CapTok):
 signed, short-lived, scoped (action, resource, rate, region).
Tool sandboxes:
 per-tool containers with 
network egress allowlists
, read-only FS, CPU/mem/time quotas, and syscall filters.
RAG allow+deny lists:
 per-connector hostname/tenant allowlists; MIME/type guards; 
content disinfect
 (strip scripts/links) before inclusion.
Result boxing:
 retrieved snippets are 
data
; they cannot alter policy. APOE treats RAG outputs as 
inputs
 only.
20.1.3 Network & SSRF threats
Vectors.
 URL fetch tools pointed at metadata endpoints, internal services, cloud IMDS; DNS rebinding; IPv6 literals; file://, gopher://.
Controls.
URL normalizer:
 reject non-HTTP(S), IP literals, link-local, or private RFC1918 addresses unless explicitly allowed.
Egress policy:
 per-tool egress via proxy with hostname pinning, TLS enforcement, and request recording into SEG.
DNS hardening:
 single trusted resolver; cache poisoning mitigations; SNI/ALPN checks.
20.1.4 Data exfiltration & privacy
Vectors.
 Model answers echo secrets; embeddings store PII; logs leak tokens; oversharing to third parties.
Controls.
PII/secret classifiers
 (regex+ML) in write paths (CMC ingest) and read paths (render).
Differential Privacy (DP)
 for analytics/telemetry; per-tenant 
ε/δ budgets
 with decay τ.
Segregated stores:
 PII on RLS-protected tables; vector store contains 
redacted/hashed
 variants; linkage via SEG only.
Synthetic labeling:
 watermark/model tags for generated content (VIF).
20.1.5 Supply chain & codegen
Vectors.
 Malicious packages, typosquatting, poisoned snippets, license traps; CI secret exposure.
Controls.
SBOM + license allowlist
 gates; 
sigstore
/SLSA provenance on artifacts.
Policy packs
 enforce banned APIs, dangerous patterns (eval, spawn) in codegen.
CI secrets broker:
 short-lived OIDC tokens from KMS; zero plaintext secrets in env/logs.
20.2 Guardrails-as-code (enforced by APOE/ACL)
We encode guardrails at 
plan
, 
step
, and 
tool
 levels. All checks emit 
witness
 events (Ch.14).
20.2.1 ACL snippets
Capability tokens & sandboxes
tool http_fetch
  caps { action:"GET", hosts:["docs.example.com"], rate:"60/m", max_bytes:5e6 }
  sandbox { net_egress:["docs.example.com:443"], fs:"ro", cpu_ms:2000, mem_mb:256, timeout_ms:3000 }
  gate { g_url_safe, g_egress_allowed, g_span_vif }
tool file_read
  caps { action:"READ", paths:["/workspace/specs/*.md"], max_bytes:1e6 }
  sandbox { fs:"ro", chroot:"/workspace", syscalls_deny:["execve","mount"] }
  gate { g_path_allow, g_span_vif }
Prompt hygiene & tainting
step synthesize_answer
  in  { query, retrieved[] }
  policy { taint: ["retrieved"], quote_untrusted:true, policy_prefix: "seg://policy/answering@v3" }
  gate { g_injection_scan, g_policy_prefix_signed, g_kappa_band }
SSRF defense for URL tools
gate g_url_safe
  checks { scheme in ["https"], host not_in private_ranges, port in [443] }
20.2.2 κ-gating & abstention
At each boundary, compute risk = f(injection_score, PII_score, UQ, budget_drift). If risk ≥ κ, the system:
abstains
 with rationale + remediation link, or
contains
 by downgrading capabilities (read-only tools, masked output), or
routes to HITL
 (Ch.17) for two-key approval.
20.3 Tool sandboxes & capability tokens (CapTok)
Design.
 A CapTok is a 
signed JWT/JWP
 with claims:
sub (plan_id/step_id), act (Verb), res (Resource pattern), lim (rate/size),
exp (TTL ≤ minutes), aud (tool runtime), jti (replay).
Runtime enforcement.
Sidecar intercepts all syscalls/network; matches against CapTok.
Violations raise 
SEG “violation” edges
 with packet metadata (no payloads with PII).
Tool outputs are labeled with cap_id for downstream audit.
Least power defaults.
No shell, no child process, no write, no outbound by default.
Explicit 
egress allowlist
; DNS pinned; TLS cert pinning optional.
20.4 Redaction, DP, and output hygiene
20.4.1 Multi-stage redaction
Ingest (CMC)
: classify and 
mask
 secrets/PII; store pointer to vaulted original (KMS-wrapped).
Index (HHNI)
: embeddings computed on 
redacted
 content; SEG retains reversible link under policy.
Render
: re-apply redaction by audience/purpose; attach VIF explaining masks.
Mask formats.
Deterministic hashes for joinability (hash(email, pepper)), reversible tokens in secure contexts, or DP-protected aggregates for analytics.
20.4.2 Differential Privacy (DP)
Event DP
 for telemetry; ε budgets per tenant/user/feature; decay (τ) resets.
Report DP
 for metrics dashboards; Laplace/Gaussian noise; ECE calibration unaffected.
SEG nodes
 store (ε, δ, mech, scope). Exceeding budget → κ-abstain.
20.5 Abstention & containment patterns
When to abstain.
UQ high (ECE band breach), RS low, policy conflict, or privacy budget exhausted.
What to return.
 A structured 
refusal diagnostic
: violated gates, minimal viable suggestions, request for narrower scope.
Containment modes.
Quarantine execution:
 simulate plan without side effects; produce diffs only.
Read-only RAG:
 disable write tools; restrict connectors.
Air-gapped chain:
 run on frozen snapshot with synthetic data.
Circuit breakers.
Token/latency/cost outliers → trip breakers; APOE rolls back to 
safe plan
 variant.
Repeated breaker trips escalate to 
HITL incident runbook
.
20.6 Tests, red teams, and continuous verification
Pre-merge gates.
Injection suite:
 curated jailbreaks + content smuggling corpora.
SSRF suite:
 private IPs, IMDS probes, DNS rebinding tests.
Secret echos:
 known canaries planted in RAG sources must 
never
 surface.
Policy pack lint:
 CSP, OPA/Rego unit tests, license/SBOM checks.
In prod.
Canary agents
 exercise tools hourly with harmless probes; anomalies → page.
Shadow mode
 for new guardrails (score only) before flip to block.
SEG queries
 look for odd patterns: tool burst w/o CapTok, egress to new host, steady κ evasion.
20.7 Threat → Control crosswalk
Threat
Primary Control
Secondary
Prompt injection (direct/indirect)
Quoted boxing + policy-prefix signing
Detector ensemble + κ
RAG-borne instruction
Data-only treatment of retrieved text
Content disinfect + provenance
SSRF via URL tool
URL normalizer + egress allowlist proxy
DNS/SNI checks, SEG logging
Secret exfiltration
PII/secret classifiers + redaction
DP budgets; vector co-location w/ redacted content
Tool overreach
CapTok (scope/TTL/rate)
Sandbox syscall/network filters
Supply-chain poison
SBOM + license allowlist + SLSA
Dependency pinning; provenance checks
Overconfidence
UQ + ECE bands + κ
HITL escalation on high-risk plans
20.8 Observability & evidence (VIF/SEG)
Every guardrail emits 
witnesses
:
policy_prefix_signed
 (template hash, signer),
cap_tok_granted/denied
 (claims, TTL),
egress_request
 (dest, bytes, allow/deny),
redaction_event
 (strategy, fields),
dp_consume
 (ε, δ, scope),
abstain/contain
 (κ, reason, suggested next).
These are 
SEG edges
 with time windows. Compliance packs (Ch.21) export them into audit bundles.
20.9 KPIs & SLOs for security posture
Injection block rate
 ≥ 99% on test corpora; 
false-positive
 ≤ 2%.
SSRF prevented
: 100% of private/IMDS probes blocked in canary.
CapTok violations
: ≤ 0.1% per 10k tool calls; MTTR < 15m.
Secret echo rate
: 0 in prod; canary only.
Abstention precision
: ≥ 0.9 (true-positive abstains / total abstains).
DP budget breaches
: 0 per month.
20.10 Failure modes & runbooks
Failure
Likely Cause
Runbook
Silent policy bypass
Missing policy-prefix or signature not verified
Freeze high-risk tools, rotate templates, audit SEG for unsigned runs
Legit request blocked (FP)
Over-eager detector
Shadow-mode compare, adjust thresholds, add test to allowlist corpus
Repeated CapTok violations
Tool wrapper drift or compromised agent
Re-issue runtimes, revoke keys, replay traces, HITL review
DP budget exhaustion
Mis-scoped aggregation
Raise τ or widen cohort; route to aggregated-only mode
20.11 Implementation quick checklist
Signed policy prelude in every chain (template hash + signer)
Quoted boxing of all untrusted content; taint propagated in ACL
URL normalizer + egress allowlist proxy for all outbound tools
Capability tokens with short TTL and minimal scopes
Per-tool sandbox profiles (fs, syscalls, CPU/mem/time)
PII/secret classifiers on write 
and
 render paths
DP budgets configured; SEG logging for ε/δ consumption
κ-gating wired to UQ, detectors, and cost/latency budgets
Canary agents and red-team suites in CI/CD
SEG wiring for all guardrail events; export hooks for audits
What this chapter unlocks.
Agentic power without fear: a system that 
remembers
 safely (CMC), 
orchestrates
 within declared limits (APOE), 
witnesses
 every decision (VIF), and 
evolves
 without drift (SDF-CVF)—because the substrate treats 
evidence as a graph
 (SEG) and security as a 
first-class capability
, not an afterthought.
Part VIII — Security, Safety, & Compliance
Chapter 21. Compliance Engineering — mapping EU AI Act/SOC2/ISO to VIF/SEG artifacts, retention vs. minimization, and incident response
Aim. Make compliance 
provable-by-construction
. Every control is a 
plan step (APOE)
, every decision is a 
witness (VIF)
, and every artifact and handshake lands in the 
Shared Evidence Graph (SEG)
 for export, replay, and audit.
21.0 Scope & stance (not legal advice)
This chapter operationalizes common obligations from the 
EU AI Act
 (risk-based duties), 
SOC 2
 (Trust Services Criteria), and 
ISO
 families (27001/27701/42001). We treat them as 
design constraints
 that the platform satisfies with built-in mechanisms: VIF provenance, SEG lineage, κ-gating/abstention, HITL, DP/redaction, and guardrails-as-code.
21.1 EU AI Act — control objectives → platform mappings
We avoid article-by-article replication and instead bind 
recurring obligations
 to concrete system levers. Use export packs (21.7) to assemble regulator-ready bundles.

SBOM
.
ISO/IEC 27701
 (PIMS): link privacy principles to mechanisms:
Lawful basis & purpose limitation → 
purpose tags
 + 
κ
 enforcement.
Minimization & retention → 
retention policies
 + 
DP
; redaction at ingest.
Data subject rights → 
subject-access/erasure flows
 (21.5).
ISO/IEC 42001
 (AI management): governance across lifecycle:
Risk registers → 
SEG risk nodes
 with owners and review cadence.
Impact assessments (AIA/RAI) → store as 
SEG dossiers
 linked to systems.
Monitoring & improvement → 
telemetry → SEG → ADRs
.
21.4 Retention vs. minimization — policies as code
Goals.
 Satisfy “keep only what you must; prove what you kept; delete when you can.” We encode this in 
Retention Policies (RP)
 bound to SEG types.
Policy model.
policy_id: rp-default-highrisk-v3
scope:
  seg_types: [ "vif:event", "tool:egress", "decision", "claim", "snapshot" ]
defaults:
  ttl_days: 190          # configurable by tenant/jurisdiction
  storage_class: WORM    # immutability for audit logs
exceptions:
  - condition: { legal_hold: true }     # incident or litigation
    override:  { ttl_days: null }       # no expiry until cleared
  - condition: { contains_pii: true, purpose: "analytics" }
    override:  { ttl_days: 30, dp: { epsilon: 1.0, delta: 1e-6 } }
erasure:
  strategy:  "cryptographic tombstone"  # delete keys, preserve non-identifying lineage
  propagate: "graph"                    # cascade to derived artifacts unless purpose-limited
Lifecycle hooks.
CMC ingest
 tags PII, purpose, consent, and jurisdiction.
HHNI
 stores 
redacted embeddings
; pointers to vaulted originals under strict scopes.
Retention executor
 runs daily; emits 
SEG “erasure”
 or 
“hold-placed/released”
 events.
21.5 Privacy UX & data subject operations
Consent & purpose.
Every plan step carries a 
purpose tag
 ("support", "analytics", "training", etc.). κ-gating refuses incompatible reuse.
Consent ledger in 
SEG
: issuance, scope, expiry, withdrawal.
Data Subject Access Request (DSAR) & Erasure (DSE).
Locate
: Query SEG across time-slices for subject identifiers and their pseudonymous joins.
Compile
: Export 
subject bundle
: sources, uses, recipients, retention, decisions affecting the subject.
Erase
: Apply cryptographic deletion to vaulted PII + cascade; retain minimal non-identifying audit lineage.
Prove
: Produce 
DSAR/DSE VIF
: queries, objects affected, timestamps, operator identity.
21.6 Incident response & notifications
Two classes: 
Security incidents
 (confidentiality/integrity/availability) and 
Model incidents
 (harmful/biased/unsafe outputs or decision flows).
Detection.
Canary agents
 exercise tools periodically;
anomaly detectors on 
κ spikes
, 
UQ drifts
, 
egress anomalies
;
“secret echo” traps in RAG corpora.
Triage.
Classify severity (S1–S4), scope (tenants, data classes), and regulatory touchpoints (privacy breach vs. robustness issue).
Containment.
Freeze affected connectors/models (feature flag); force 
quarantine mode
 (read-only, no tool writes).
Place 
legal hold
 on relevant SEG nodes; snapshot state.
Eradication & recovery.
Patch/rollback via 
SDF-CVF
; retest with red-team suites; gradually unquarantine.
Notification.
Generate 
regulatory pack
 (below) with incident timeline, affected data categories, mitigation, and contact.
Respect jurisdictional windows (e.g., privacy laws often require notification without undue delay; coordinate with counsel).
21.7 Export packs (one-click audit bundles)
Structure.
/export_pack_YYYYMMDDTHHMMZ/
  manifest.json          # hash tree, versions, scope
  policy_prefix.txt      # signed templates in force
  model_card.json        # model/weights/prompt template hashes
  data_sheets/           # sources, redaction/DP config
  vif_traces.ndjson      # step-by-step plan witnesses
  seg_graph.jsonld       # time-sliced evidence graph
  risk_register.json     # risks, owners, reviews
  sbom/                  # supply chain attestations (SLSA, sigstore)
  dp_ledger.csv          # epsilon/delta consumption
  consent_ledger.csv     # consents by subject/purpose
  hitl_approvals.csv     # two-key records for high-risk actions
  test_results/          # red-team suites, accuracy/calibration
  incident_report/       # if applicable
  signatures/            # package signing, key metadata
Generation.
apoe export --scope high_risk --timeslice "2025-01-01..2025-03-31" --tenant acme --signed
21.8 Control verification — tests & monitoring
Pre-deployment
: policy-pack lint; segregation tests; DP budget simulators; calibration (ECE) checks; adversarial corpora for jailbreak/SSRF/secret-echo.
In prod
: SLIs for lineage completeness, κ-abstention precision, RS-lift stability, DP budget headroom, CapTok violation rate, DSAR/DSE latency.
Pass/Fail samples.
Lineage completeness
 ≥ 99% for high-risk flows (no orphaned outputs).
ECE
 ≤ target band (e.g., 0.03) on evaluation sets.
DSAR/DSE
 service levels (e.g., compile ≤ X days, erase ≤ Y days) tracked as SLOs.
21.9 Checklists (implementation quick start)
Platform wiring
Policy-prefix signing enforced; template hashes in VIF
All tool calls require valid 
CapTok
; sandbox profiles applied
VIF/SEG enabled on every APOE boundary; time-sliced graph API live
Redaction at ingest; embeddings on redacted text; DP ledger active
Purpose/consent tags mandatory; κ refuses incompatible reuse
Retention policy engine with legal hold + erasure propagation
DSAR/DSE flow exercised end-to-end; witness emitted
Export pack CLI enabled; signatures verified in CI
Incident runbooks rehearsed (tabletop & live canaries)
Org/process
Risk register owners assigned; review cadence in SEG
Role catalogs & two-key approvers defined
License/SBOM policies set; SLSA/Sigstore in pipeline
Training & comms: transparency and user notices templated
21.10 What this unlocks
Pre-baked proof.
 Auditors don’t just get PDFs—they get 
replayable traces
 and a 
time-sliced evidence graph
.
Privacy by architecture.
 Redaction, purpose tags, DP budgets, and retention policies are not documents; they’re 
executable controls
.
Resilience with accountability.
 When the system abstains, contains, or quarantines, it can 
show why
, who approved exceptions, and how it recovered.

Thought for 10s
Part IX — Evaluation, Benchmarks, & Observability
Chapter 22. Retrieval & Reasoning Benchmarks — p@k, nDCG, RS-lift, κ/ECE dashboards, long-horizon agent evaluation
Aim. Establish 
provable, repeatable
 measurements for (a) retrieval quality, (b) reasoning calibration and abstention, and (c) 
long-horizon agent
 success under budgets—grounded in VIF/SEG so every score has a witness and a replay.
22.0 Scope & outcomes
What this chapter delivers
Metric definitions and 
exact formulas
 (p@k, recall@k, MRR, MAP, nDCG, ECE).
RS-lift
 protocol that ties HHNI/DVNS improvements to outcome deltas per unit 
token/latency cost
.
A 
κ (kappa) & calibration
 dashboard spec (coverage vs. risk, reliability diagrams, selective prediction).
A 
long-horizon agent
 eval harness: success, budget adherence, repair rate, determinism, and safety outcomes.
Gold-set curation, adversarial suites, contamination checks, and 
promotion gates
 for shipping.
Principles
Relevance before eloquence
: judge retrieval first; judge wording second.
Calibrate or abstain
: it’s better to say “I don’t know (κ)” than to be confidently wrong.
Show your work
: every metric point links to 
VIF/SEG
 entries for replay.
22.1 Retrieval metrics (definitions & usage)
Let each query 
have gold relevant set 
, system returns 
ranked list
 
with per-item RS/score.
Precision@k (p@k)
Recall@k (r@k)
MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank)
Let 
be rank of first relevant item (∞ if none).
Average Precision (AP) & MAP
nDCG@k (normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)
With graded relevance 
,
When to use what
p@k
 for answerable Q&A where 1–3 chunks suffice.
MRR
 when “first hit fast” matters (tool routing).
MAP/nDCG
 for multi-facet or graded relevance (legal, biomedical).
Always segment by 
query class
 (one-hop, multi-hop, long-context, adversarial).
Traceability
Each run emits a 
Retrieval VIF
: model id, index snapshot, RS parameters, and per-query ranked list with 
claim→evidence edges
 in SEG.
22.2 RS-lift: tying HHNI/DVNS to outcome & cost
Define 
baseline
 
and 
candidate
 
(e.g., HHNI weights, DVNS forces).
Lift metrics
Δp@k = p@k(C) − p@k(B)
; same for nDCG/MAP.
Cost-normalized lift
:
Choose 
from SLOs (ms ↔ token budget).
Significance
Use 
paired bootstrap
 over queries; report 95% CI.
Guardrail: do 
not
 promote if CI crosses 0 or if 
cost headroom
 is exceeded.
Protocol
Freeze 
index snapshot
 & model versions (VIF).
Run B and C with identical queries, seeds, budgets.
Emit 
SEG diff
 (edges added/removed, RS distributions).
Promote only if 
Lift_eff ≥ θ
 and safety metrics unchanged or better.
22.3 κ & calibration: abstention and reliability dashboards
Selective prediction (κ)
The system abstains when 
or 
.
Coverage
 
.
Risk-coverage curve
: plot error vs. coverage as thresholds vary; choose operating point that meets SLOs.
Expected Calibration Error (ECE)
Bucket predicted confidences 
into 
; with accuracy 
and mean confidence 
:
Report 
ECE@domain
 and 
MaxCE
.
Reliability diagram
10–20 bins; overlay 
perfect calibration line
; show 
pre/post temperature scaling
.
Selective F1 / AUROC (optional)
For binary answerability gates; track per domain/task.
Dashboard spec (tiles)
Abstention tile
: coverage, abstention precision/recall.
Calibration tile
: ECE, diagram, temp parameter.
UQ provenance tile
: which method (ensemble, temp sweep), seed, κ thresholds (all in VIF).
Budget tile
: tokens/latency vs. target at chosen κ.
22.4 Long-horizon agent evaluation (streams & plans)
Agents execute 
APOE plans
 (DAGs) over time with tool calls, memory writes, and HITL gates.
Core outcomes
Task Success (TS%)
: pass/fail against verifiable acceptance tests (SEG decision nodes).
Budget Adherence (BA)
: 
over tokens, time, tool calls.
Repair Rate (RR)
: fraction of runs requiring auto-fix or quarantine.
Determinism (Det@seed)
: Jaccard similarity of step sequences under fixed seed/context.
HITL Utilization
: approvals requested/granted; median time-to-merge.
Safety Outcomes
: injection/exfiltration incidents caught (pre-execution) vs. blocked (at execution) vs. leaked.
Trace-level metrics
κ_chain
: fraction of boundary gates abstained; false-abstain vs. true-abstain.
Step F1
: compare planned vs. executed steps (name+contract).
Lineage Fidelity
: % artifacts with complete VIF; 
Replay Rate
: % traces that re-execute to same verdict.
Scenarios
Streamed tasks
: evolving requirements, rolling memory (CMC snapshots).
Multi-hop research/code
: retrieval→reason→verify loops.
Tool-rich runs
: browser, code exec, DB, vector search; injection probes embedded.
Harness requirements
Freeze 
policy-prefix
, models, indices (VIF).
Record 
every boundary
 (inputs, outputs, UQ, κ).
Emit SEG graph; produce 
agent scorecard
 per run + aggregates.
22.5 Gold sets & adversarial suites
Gold sets (by domain)
Atomic Q&A
: single-hop fact with citations.
Multi-hop
: requires 2–3 evidence items with chain-of-thought 
not
 evaluated, only 
evidence linkage
.
Procedural
: “do X with tool Y” judged by outcome log.
Coding
: compile/test verdicts, coverage thresholds.
Long-context
: key facts in middle of ~50–200k tokens (LIM stress).
Adversarial suites
Injection
: prompt smuggling, casing/encoding, indirect attack through retrieved docs.
Exfiltration
: secret-echo canaries, connector abuse.
Spec drift
: conflicting instructions across time-slices.
Ambiguity
: lexical traps, polysemy (“hot dog” vs “dog”).
Reasoning traps
: numerical edge cases, unit conversions, date arithmetic.
Contamination checks
Hash gold materials; check 
train overlap
; if uncertain, gate with 
counterfactual variants
.

may ship
 only if:
Lift_eff ≥ θ
 (org-set, e.g., +0.02 nDCG per 1k tokens) with CI > 0.
ECE ≤ band
 (e.g., ≤ 0.03) 
and
 selective risk curve within SLO.
TS% non-degrading
 on long-horizon suites; 
BA ≥ 0.95
; 
RR ≤ 0.1
.

Enable full VIF + OpenTelemetry.
After running
Compute deltas + CI; inspect outlier queries.
Review κ operating point vs. SLOs.
Attach SEG slice + VIF packet; archive export pack.
Part IX — Evaluation, Benchmarks, & Observability
Chapter 23. Observability & Costing — OpenTelemetry for agents, token/latency budgets, drift & prompt-rot monitors, SLOs and error budgets
Aim. Give AIMOS/APOE 
production-grade sight
: every plan, step, retrieval, tool call, HITL decision, and cost is 
traced, measured, and governed
. Observability is not a dashboard—it’s the 
nervous system
 that enforces budgets, detects drift, and protects SLOs.
23.0 Scope & outcomes
This chapter delivers
A complete 
OpenTelemetry (OTel)
 spec for agents, memory, retrieval, and tools (spans, metrics, logs, exemplars).
Token/latency/cost budgets
 with admission control, backoff, and graceful degradation.
Drift & prompt-rot monitors
 for data, behavior, and templates (with alerting).
SLOs & error budgets
 (definitions, burn-rate alerts, runbooks).
Principles
Everything is a step
 → everything is observable.
Budgets are contracts
 → enforced at compile-time (APOE) and run-time (gates).
Detection without lineage is noise
 → all alerts attach a SEG slice & VIF packet.
23.1 OpenTelemetry for agents (traces, metrics, logs)
23.1.1 Trace model (span taxonomy)
Root
apoe.plan — one per compiled plan execution (DAG).
Attributes: plan.id, plan.version, snapshot.id, policy.prefix.version, kappa.operating_point, budget.tokens.max, budget.latency.ms.max.
Children (typical)
apoe.step — per step (role-typed).
Attr: step.id, step.role 
∈
 {planner|retriever|reasoner|verifier|builder|critic|operator|witness},
budget.tokens.max, budget.latency.ms.max, inputs.hash, prompt.template.hash, model.id, weights.hash.
Events: gate.enter, gate.exit, abstain.kappa, redaction.applied, quarantine.start, rollback.
Status: OK|ERROR|ABSTAIN.
cmc.write / cmc.read — memory atomization/index I/O.
Attr: atoms.count, ids.depth, dd.delta, snapshot.id.
rag.query — HHNI/DVNS retrieval.
Attr: k, rs.mean, rs.p95, ids.mean, dd.mean, index.snapshot.id.
tool.exec — sandboxed external call (browser, code runner, DB).
Attr: tool.name, capTok.id, arguments.hash, egress.bytes, sandbox.policy.id.
hitl.review — human approval steps.
Attr: risk.score, two_key.required, approver.role, decision.
seg.write — evidence graph updates.
Attr: nodes.count, edges.count, contradictions.count.
Correlation
Use trace_id across spans; attach 
VIF ids
 (model/prompt/index hashes) to every boundary span.
Include seg.slice.id on any span that asserts/derives a claim.
23.1.2 Metrics (RED/USE + agent-specific)
Counters
tokens.in.total, tokens.out.total (by model.id, role, tenant).
tool.exec.count{tool.name, outcome}.
abstain.count{kappa.reason} (low RS, high UQ, policy).
Histograms
latency.ms{role|tool|retrieval} (p50/p90/p95/p99).
rs.score (retrieval score distribution).
uq.confidence (post-calibration).
Gauges
budget.tokens.remaining (plan & step).
index.size.documents, mem.snapshot.bytes.
cost.usd.current_hour (derived; see §23.2).
Exemplars
Attach trace_id exemplars to latency and cost histograms so outliers hyperlink to traces.
23.1.3 Logs (structured)
Boundary logs
 (JSON): inputs/outputs digests, κ decisions, redactions applied, gate verdicts.
Audit logs
: HITL actions, policy overrides, export pack creation.
Security logs
: injection triggers, exfiltration blocks (include payload hashes, not raw content).
Retention
: per compliance policy (see Part VIII): e.g., 6–12 months with 
privacy-first redaction
 at ingestion.
23.2 Token/latency budgets & costing
23.2.1 Budget objects (declared in ACL & enforced)
Per step
budget:
  tokens:
    max: 12000
    soft: 10000
    backoff: summarize|truncate|route_smaller_model
  latency_ms:
    max: 2500
    soft: 1800
  tools:
    max_calls: 3
Per plan
Sum of step budgets with headroom factor 
(default 1.1).
Violation raises budget.exceeded event → see §23.2.3.
23.2.2 Cost model
Let p_in, p_out be USD per 1K tokens for the model.id.
Per step cost:
Aggregate to cost.plan.usd. Emit to gauge cost.usd.current_hour and counter cost.usd.total.
Capacity planning (monthly)
Segment by tenant/domain; alert on 20% deviation.
23.2.3 Admission control & graceful degradation
At compile time (APOE)
Static checks ensure budgets exist for every step; reject plan if missing.
At run time
If soft exceeded:
Summarize
 context (dumbbell compression) and retry once.
Route
 to a cheaper model with higher κ (more abstention).
Truncate
 non-critical attachments (policy-aware).
If max exceeded → abstain.kappa(budget) and escalate to hitl.review when configured.
Pseudocode
if tokens.used > soft:
  context' = compress(context, policy="dumbbell")
  rerun(step, context')
if tokens.used' > max:
  emit(abstain.kappa, reason="budget")
  route(HITL | cheaper_model)
23.3 Drift & prompt-rot monitors
Why
: HHNI/DVNS, models, and prompts evolve. We detect 
data drift
, 
behavior drift
, and 
template rot
 early—with lineage.
23.3.1 Data drift (retrieval/memory)
Embedding drift
: monitor centroid shift 
per corpus; alarm when > θ.
Distribution shift
: KL-divergence of RS histograms between windows.
Index health
: IDS (indexing depth score) mean/variance; drop indicates ingestion or tagging failure.
LIM sentinel
: p@k for mid-placement canaries (lost-in-the-middle probes).
Alert
: drift.data with SEG slice listing affected indices/snapshots.
23.3.2 Behavior drift (model & agent)
Canary suite deltas
: weekly run of fixed gold sets; compare MAP/nDCG and κ coverage at same thresholds.
UQ calibration drift
: ECE delta > θ; triggers temperature re-fit.
Action profile shift
: step distribution (planner vs. retriever vs. verifier) changes (χ² test) → may indicate routing regression.
Alert
: drift.behavior with VIF (model hash change?) and trace exemplars.
23.3.3 Prompt-rot monitors (templates & policies)
Template hash
 mismatch (prompt.template.hash) vs. approved registry → block in staging, warn in prod.
Policy-prefix diff
: semantic distance > θ (embed-compare) → requires two-key approval.
Guardrail efficacy
: injection block rate ↓ while injection attempts ↑ → investigate.
Alert
: rot.prompt → auto-create ADR stub & require HITL review.
23.4 SLOs & error budgets
23.4.1 SLIs (service level indicators)
Availability
plan.success.rate = OK plans / total (exclude κ-abstentions with reason=policy if within spec).
Quality
answer.accept.rate = plans passing acceptance tests (from Ch.22 gold sets).
retrieval.ndcg.p95 by domain.
Performance
latency.ms.p95 per plan class; tool.exec.p95.
Cost
tokens.per.plan.median, cost.usd.per.plan.p95.
Safety
injection.block.rate, exfiltration.prevented.rate.
23.4.2 SLOs & budgets (examples)
Availability: 
≥ 99.5%
 monthly.
Quality: 
answer.accept.rate ≥ 80%
 on tier-A suites.
Performance: 
p95 latency ≤ 2.5s
 (query class A).
Cost: 
median tokens/plan ≤ 9k
.
Safety: 
injection.block.rate ≥ 99.9%
.
Error budget
 for Availability:
e.g., 0.5% of 30 days = 3h 36m downtime.
23.4.3 Burn-rate alerting (multi-window)
Use 
multi-window multi-burn (MWMB)
:
Fast window
: 1 hour; 
Slow
: 6 or 24 hours.
Alert if
Tie alerts to runbooks with pre-approved mitigations.
23.4.4 Runbooks (automations)
Latency breach
 → enable aggressive summarization, reduce k in RAG, switch model tier.
Cost breach
 → raise κ (more abstentions), gate tool calls, enforce stricter soft budgets.
Quality breach
 → pin model to last-known-good, roll back index snapshot, route to verifier-heavy plan.
Safety breach
 → escalate to containment profile: tool off, only retrieval + summarize, HITL mandatory.
Each action emits a governance.change event with SEG export.
23.5 Dashboards & exemplars (what to ship)
Top-level (Ops)
SLO tiles with burn-rate sparkline, error-budget remaining.
p95 latency, cost p95, success rate, κ coverage.
Agent (Plan)
Steps waterfall (trace), tokens in/out stacked by role, κ boundaries hit.
RS distribution vs. threshold, IDS trend, DD (dependency delta) histogram.
Retrieval
nDCG@10 over time, LIM sentinels, RS-lift vs. baseline (from Ch.22).
Safety
Injection attempts vs. blocks, exfiltration prevented, redaction counts.
Each tile supports 
click-through to exemplars
 (OTel trace + SEG slice + VIF packet).
23.6 Alerts, tickets, and exports
Alerts open tickets with 
attached export packs
: metrics snapshot, top offending traces, SEG lineage, and the exact VIF (model/prompt/index hashes).
Exports are 
privacy-scrubbed
 at source (PII redaction), signed, and stored with retention policy.
23.7 Quick checklists
Instrumentation
All APOE steps emit apoe.step spans with budgets & VIF hashes.
Retrieval emits RS/IDS/DD; memory emits snapshot ids.
Tools carry capTok.id and sandbox policy labels.
Budgets & Cost
Budgets declared in ACL for every step/plan.
Admission control + graceful degradation configured.
Cost forecasting vs. actual alerts enabled.
Drift & Rot
Embedding & RS distribution monitors on; LIM sentinels active.
Weekly canary suite; ECE drift alarms.
Template/policy hashes pinned; diffs require two-key.
SLOs
SLIs defined & computed; SLOs published per plan class.
MWMB alerting wired to runbooks; governance events logged.
23.8 Minimal reference (names & attributes)
Span names
: apoe.plan, apoe.step, cmc.write, cmc.read, rag.query, tool.exec, hitl.review, seg.write, governance.change.
Key attrs
: plan.id, step.role, budget.tokens.max, tokens.in/out, latency.ms, rs, uq, kappa, model.id, weights.hash, prompt.template.hash, index.snapshot.id, capTok.id.
Metrics
: tokens.in.total, tokens.out.total, latency.ms, rs.score, uq.confidence, cost.usd.*, abstain.count, tool.exec.count.
Logs
: gate.verdict, abstain.kappa, redaction, quarantine, rollback, hitl.decision.
Part X — Case Studies & Patterns
Chapter 24. Machine Communication — protocol translation, negotiation, device/file diplomacy (with traces, budgets, SEG lineage)
Aim. Show AIMOS/APOE acting as a 
machine-communication system
—bridging humans, documents, tools, and devices—with 
memory-native retrieval (CMC/HHNI), compiled orchestration (APOE/ACL), verifiable lineage (VIF/SEG),
 and safe evolution (SDF-CVF). Each case provides: scenario, APOE plan, budgets, OpenTelemetry trace, VIF packet, SEG slice, failure modes, and playbooks.
24.0 Patterns at a glance
Protocol translation:
 “speak both ways” across formats and APIs; preserve semantics and provenance.
Negotiation & mediation:
 structured bargaining under constraints; κ-aware abstention; HITL where risk>θ.
Device & file diplomacy:
 hostile inputs, partial parses, capability tokens, and redaction by default.

24.1 Case Study A — Protocol Translation (CSV ledger → JSON API → signed PDF)
Scenario.
 A finance team uploads a monthly CSV ledger and needs a JSON batch for a RegTech API plus a signed PDF summary. Constraints: PII masking, schema drift handling, and reproducible outputs.
Inputs.
User artifact: ledger_2025_09.csv (unknown dialect).
Target: REST /v2/transactions (OpenAPI v3).
Policy: mask acct_number except last 4; round totals to 2dp.
Success criteria.
Schema fidelity ≥ 99.5% rows accepted by API sandbox.
PII masked; SEG lineage resolvable from PDF to raw CSV.
Cost ≤ $0.02 per 1k rows; p95 latency ≤ 2.5s for 50k rows.

Failure modes & playbooks.
Schema drift:
 validator rejects >0.5% → κ abstain + planner regenerates field_map from nearest prior mapping; HITL diff shown.
PII leakage:
 gate fails → auto-redact + re-validate; repeated failure quarantines branch.
Cost spike:
 increase batch size, reduce k in RAG, or route cheaper model for map_schema.
KPIs.
 acceptance≥0.995, RS-lift vs. baseline KNN ≥ +0.06, p95 latency≤2.5s, cost p95 plan≤$0.98.
24.2 Case Study B — Negotiation & Mediation (SLA slotting across constrained APIs)
Scenario.
 A logistics broker negotiates pickup windows among three carriers’ APIs with conflicting constraints (weight limits, blackout dates, surge pricing). AIMOS/APOE mediates a Pareto-feasible schedule.
Inputs.
3 OpenAPI specs + policy clauses (penalties, PII rules).
Shipment bundle (weights, origins, deadlines).
Success criteria.
 Feasible plan with 
dominated-option pruning
, cost ≤ target, and 
auditable counteroffer tree
.

Trace highlights.
rag.query retrieved prior 
carrier quirks
 (RS.p50=0.77).
operator made 7 signed calls (capTok ids recorded).
reconcile produced Pareto set size=4; 
dominance_pruned=true
.
negotiate converged after 2 rounds; p95 roundtrip=620ms.
VIF essentials.
Model/weights/prompt hashes for reconcile step included; risk model version noted.
Tool identities + capTok ids; tariffs snapshot id.
SEG slice (offer lineage).
Nodes: offer:A#102, offer:B#88, counter:C#44, decision:bundle#Q4.
Edges: supports, dominates, accepts, rejects, with timestamps; 
contradiction edges
 retained to record declined offers (SEG design).
Failure modes.
Non-convergence:
 κ abstain with proposal set + 
HITL two-key
 to select compromise.
API instability:
 operator routes through cached spec; falls back to email template generator with VIF tag fallback.email.
KPIs.
 Dominance pruning ratio≥0.5; cost within target±3%; κ true-positive abstention≥95% (only when needed).
24.3 Case Study C — Device & File Diplomacy (sensor logs → safe analytics)
Scenario.
 Field sensors upload mixed archives (.zip with .bin, .csv, unknown .dat). Need: sanitize, parse partially, extract metrics, and publish a dashboard—
without exfiltrating secrets
 and with 
time-sliced evidence
.
Inputs.
 Device blobs + data dictionary (sometimes stale).
Success criteria.
 Max salvage; zero secret leakage; reproducible metrics; SEG time slicing so analysts can “rewind.”
APOE plan (hostile-input first)

Budgets.
 Constrained tools; 
air-gapped
 unpack; no external calls during partial_parse.
Trace.
fingerprint flagged 1 suspicious .dat (YARA rule hit) → 
containment
 applied; file quarantined, not parsed.
partial_parse used 
pattern mining
 on rejects with 
no outbound I/O
; decoded 62% extra rows.
metrics QC: gap rate 1.3% (<2% threshold).
seg.write: contradiction edges for quarantined file (recorded, not deleted).
VIF.
Tools with policy tags: safe_unzip[airgap], bin_decoder@0.3.
UQ for inferred decoders: ensemble.var=0.11, ECE=0.028 → confidence band displayed.
SEG (time-sliced).
source:zip:4e9a → artifact:records:day=2025-09-28
contradicts edge to source:dat:9b17 (quarantine reason: YARA-sig-MQTTkey)
decision:qc.ok supports claim:timeseries.published.
Failure modes.
Decoder hallucination risk:
 if ECE>0.05, κ abstain from publishing; HITL required to approve provisional decoder with diff view.
Secret exfiltration attempt:
 tool policy blocks; event logged; pipeline switches to 
contain_only
.
KPIs.
 Salvage ratio≥0.85, QC pass rate≥0.98, zero exfiltration incidents, reproducible rebuild from SEG slice.
24.4 Reusable assets
ACL templates (starters).
translate_protocol_v2.acl — CSV/JSON/PDF chain with PII gates.
negotiate_bids_v1.acl — multi-round mediator with dominance pruning.
ingest_device_airgap.acl — hostile-input plan with quarantine/contain.
Policy packs.
pii.masking.v5, capTok.carrier_ops.v3, airgap.unpack.v2, containment.strict.v1.
Dashboards.
Case-specific tiles (acceptance, dominance, salvage) + 
exemplar links
 (trace + SEG + VIF).
24.5 What this demonstrates
CMC/HHNI
 keeps translation and negotiation grounded in 
retrievable
 history (mappings, quirks, policies).
APOE/ACL
 compiles interactions into 
deterministic, budgeted plans
, not ad-hoc chats.
VIF/SEG
 makes every artifact 
auditable
—from a signed PDF back to a masked CSV; from a counteroffer back to API quotes; from a timeseries back to quarantined files.
SDF-CVF
 enforces 
parity
: specs, code, tags, and traces change together—or not at all.
Checklists
Before running a new “machine-communication” integration
Prior mappings and policies retrieved (RS≥0.75).
Plan budgets present; κ thresholds defined.
Tool capability tokens scoped; sandbox policies active.
VIF fields (model/prompt/index hashes) wired at each boundary.
SEG export pack enabled for the final artifact.
Acceptance gates (per case)
Protocol translation: validator acceptance≥0.995; PII masked.
Negotiation: Pareto set produced; risk<0.6 (or two-key).
Device diplomacy: QC passed; secrets contained; ECE within band.

Chapter 26. Ops & Incidents — Log Forensics, RCA with VIF/SEG, and Safe Autoremediation
Aim. Turn 
telemetry into evidence
,

Shared Evidence Graph (SEG)
, and 
autorem
ediation
 playbooks with κ-gating, canaries, and two-key approval where risk demands it.
26.0 Operating Model & Severity Taxonomy
Roles.
Incident Commander (IC)
 — owns timeline & decisions.
Resolver(s)
 — service owners, on-call engineers.
Witness
 — curates VIF packets / SEG links in real time.
Scribe
 — maintains immutable timeline; exports post-hoc pack.
Comms
 — stakeholder/customer comms.
Severities.
SEV-1
 customer-visible outage or legal risk → HITL two-key required.
SEV-2
 partial impact; degraded SLOs → guarded auto-remediation allowed.
SEV-3
 limited scope; error budget burn detected.
SEV-4
 near-miss, anomaly only; create watch & experiment.
Golden clocks.
MTTD
 (detect), 
MTTI
 (IC engaged), 
MTTC
 (contain), 
MTTR
 (restore), 
MTTP
 (publish postmortem). Targets are declared per service.
26.1 Signal Surface & Ingestion
Four signals
 (OpenTelemetry aligned): 
metrics, logs, traces, events
.
Required invariants:
 time sync (NTP), 
snapshot IDs
 embedded in every span/log, PII-safe redaction at ingress.
Forensic log schema (normalized).

 tuples (tool versions, hashes) to guarantee replay.
26.2 Log Forensics: Patterns & Queries
Canonical patterns.
Prompt-injection:
 sudden spike in policy.violations + new referers.
Exfil/SSRF:
 unusual egress domains, blocked capability tokens.
Cost runaway:
 token spend derivative > threshold, RS-lift ↓.
Drift/prompt-rot:
 κ-abstentions ↑ + ECE ↑ + RS distribution shift.
Data leakage near-miss:
 redactor blocks > baseline p95.
Query snippets (illustrative).
Time-boxed anomaly burst (SQL-ish):
SELECT window_start, COUNT(*) AS inj_attempts
FROM logs
WHERE msg='prompt_injection_detected'
  AND ts BETWEEN now()-INTERVAL '30 minutes' AND now()
GROUP BY TUMBLE(ts, INTERVAL '5 minutes')
HAVING COUNT(*) > baseline * 2.5;
Trace join to recent changes:
SELECT l.trace_id, d.pr_number, d.change_type
FROM logs l
JOIN deployment_events d
  ON l.snapshot_id = d.snapshot_id
WHERE l.level='ERROR' AND d.deployed_at >= now()-INTERVAL '2h';
26.3 RCA with the Shared Evidence Graph (SEG)
RCA goal.
 Produce a 
time-sliced subgraph
 linking symptoms → spans/logs → changes → decisions → sources, then attach a 
Decision
 node with remediations.
Minimal nodes.
 Symptom, Span, Log, Metric, Change, Spec, Claim, Decision, Gate, ToolCall, Snapshot.
Cypher (example) — “What changed before the first error?”
MATCH (e:Log {level:'ERROR'})-[:IN_TRACE]->(t:Trace)
WHERE e.ts >= $t0 AND e.ts <= $t1
MATCH (t)-[:HAS_SNAPSHOT]->(s:Snapshot)<-[:DEPLOYED]-(c:Change)
WHERE c.at <= e.ts AND c.at >= e.ts - duration('PT2H')
RETURN e, t, s, c ORDER BY e.ts ASC LIMIT 50;
SPARQL (lineage to data source).
SELECT ?claim ?artifact ?source WHERE {
  ?claim a seg:Claim ;
         seg:derivesFrom ?artifact .
  ?artifact seg:supports ?source .
  FILTER (?claim = seg:Claim_release_rc_0_3)
}
Eight-step RCA loop.
Freeze
 time window; snapshot SEG slice.
Cluster
 symptoms (logs/metrics/traces).
Correlate
 to changes/spec diffs.
Validate
 with RS-lift & UQ deltas.
Hypothesize
 (explicit Claim).
Experiment
 in canary; capture VIF.
Decide
 (promote/revert/patch).
Record
 Decision & link all artifacts (no deletions—use contradicts edges).
26.4 Incident Pipelines in ACL (APOE)
Detection→Triage→Containment→Recovery plan.
pipeline incident_sev2_cost_spike
  input { window: time_range, service: id }
  budget { tokens.max: 8k, latency_ms.max: 120000, tools.max_calls: 10 }
  step detect(role: operator)
    tool: cost_anomaly_detector
    out: anomaly_report
    gate: { anomaly.p_value <= 0.01 }
  step correlate(role: witness)
    tool: seg_query
    in: anomaly_report
    out: change_set, seg_slice
    gate: { change_set.nonempty? }
  step contain(role: operator)
    tool: feature_flags
    in: change_set
    out: toggles_off
    policy: least_disruption
  step recover(role: builder)
    tool: rollback_manager
    in: change_set
    out: rollback_done
    gate: { canary.ok && error_budget.burn_rate < 1.0 }
  step witness(role: witness)
    out: vif_packet, decision_node
κ-gating.
 If UQ.calibration deteriorates or RS-lift<0, 
abstain
 and escalate to HITL.
26.5 Safe Autoremediation: Guardrails & Playbooks
Guardrails.
Scope caps:
 only toggle flags / revert 
recent
 change set.
Budget caps:
 token/latency ceilings; auto-stop at 80% of cap.
Canaries:
 ≤5% traffic; promote only if SLOs green for N intervals.
Two-key:
 SEV-1 or 
compliance-critical
 flows require human approval.
Snap-first:
 all actions bind to a snapshot_id; rollback is deterministic.
Witnessing:
 every step emits VIF & SEG edges.
Playbook 1 — Cost Runaway (RAG).
pipeline remediate_cost_runaway
  step adjust_rag(role: operator)
    tool: config_editor
    in: { top_k: current }
    out: { top_k: max(current-3, 3) }
    gate: { rs_lift >= -0.01 }   # do-no-harm guard
  step swap_embedder(role: operator)
    tool: model_switch
    in: { embedder: "v-large" }
    out: { embedder: "v-medium" }
    gate: { drift.delta <= 0.02 }
  step canary(role: operator)
    tool: canary_runner
    out: canary_ok
    gate: { slo.p95_latency <= target && rs_lift >= -0.005 }
Playbook 2 — Prompt-Rot / Drift.
pipeline remediate_prompt_rot
  step calibrate(role: verifier)
    tool: temp_sweep
    out: ece
    gate: { ece <= 0.03 }
  step template_fallback(role: builder)
    tool: prompt_templates
    in: { template: "main" }
    out: { template: "fallback_v2" }
    gate: { goldset.f1 >= policy.min_f1 }
  step retrain_calibrator(role: builder)
    tool: calibrator_fit
    out: new_calibrator
Playbook 3 — Security Event (SSRF/Exfil).
pipeline remediate_security_event
  step revoke(role: operator) tool: token_revoker
  step isolate(role: operator) tool: sandbox_enforcer
  step blocklist(role: operator) tool: egress_filter
  step audit(role: witness) -> seg_incident_package
26.6 Post-Incident: Evidence, Learning, and SDF-CVF
Postmortem (blameless, time-boxed).
What/When:
 timeline from SEG; attach spans/logs/decisions.
Why:
 primary + contributing factors; model: 
technical + organizational
.
So what:
 user impact, legal/compliance notes; cost.
Now what:
 
atomic
 change set across 
code/docs/tags/traces
 (SDF-CVF), new tests, updated runbooks, monitors.
SEG export pack contents.
Time-sliced subgraph (JSON-LD).
VIF packet bundle (model/tool/prompt hashes).
Redacted logs/metrics/traces.
Decisions & ADRs.
Retention schedule & labels.
DORA-aligned updates.
CFR, MTTR, deployment frequency, lead time — tied to incident cohort.
26.7 KPIs, SLOs, and Error Budgets (Ops)
Detect:
 MTTD p50/p95.
Contain:
 MTTC; % incidents contained by canary.
Restore:
 MTTR; rollback success rate.
Correctness:
 RCA completeness (graph coverage ≥ X%), replay fidelity=100%.
Safety:
 κ-abstention true-positive rate; 
HITL latency
 p95.
Cost:
 token/latency budget adherence; 
auto-remediation success
 without regression ≥ Y%.
Quality:
 RS-lift post-fix ≥ 0; ECE within band.
26.8 End-to-End Example (Condensed Timeline)
00:00
 Pager triggers: cost anomaly (p=0.007).
00:02
 IC engaged; κ gates new complex chains.
00:05
 SEG query links spike to change_set C-142 (RAG top-k=20).
00:09
 Playbook “cost runaway” lowers top_k to 8; canary 5% passes.
00:15
 Promote canary to 50%; SLOs hold; RS-lift −0.003 (within guard).
00:20
 Full traffic restored; auto-rollback prepared as shadow.
00:35
 Decision node promote_fix recorded; VIF bundle sealed.
02:00
 Postmortem draft with SEG export pack; SDF-CVF commit adds tests to guard top-k regression.
26.9 Checklists
During incident
IC named; comms set.
Snapshot and time window frozen.
Forensic pipeline redaction verified.
SEG edges: symptoms↔changes linked.
κ-gates active on high-risk steps.
Canaries before production switches.
VIF packets emitted at every boundary.
After incident
Postmortem published; export pack archived.
SDF-CVF atomic patch merged (code/docs/tags/traces).
Monitors/runbooks updated; drills scheduled.
Error-budget policy reviewed.
Part XI — Reference Implementations
Chapter 27. Data Schemas — Atom/Edge (CMC/HHNI), SEG JSON-LD, and ACL AST
Aim. Make 
memory
, 
evidence
, and 
orchestration
 concrete and interoperable. This chapter defines canonical schemas for (1) CMC/HHNI atoms & edges, (2) the Shared Evidence Graph (SEG) in JSON-LD, and (3) the APOE orchestration AST for ACL. All schemas are versioned, time-sliced, and provenance-aware (VIF).
27.0 Conventions (applies to all schemas)
ID
: uuidv7 (string).
Timestamps
: RFC 3339/ISO-8601 UTC (2025-10-17T12:34:56Z).
Versioning
: schema_version uses semver; breaking changes bump MAJOR.
Hashing
: sha256_hex of canonical bytes (UTF-8, normalized newlines).
Time-slicing
: valid_from, valid_to (null = open-ended).
Provenance
 (VIF tuple): (model_id, weights_hash, prompt_template_id, tool_ids[], snapshot_id) recorded on any write.
27.1 CMC/HHNI — Atom & Edge Schemas
27.1.1 Atom (memory node)
Purpose.
 The smallest addressable unit of memory (or a container “molecule”). Every atom is embeddable, indexed (HHNI path), and snapshotted.

code:ts, code:py, code:sql, code:dockerfile
event:log, event:span, event:metric
prompt:user, prompt:system, prompt:tool
asset:image, asset:audio, asset:pdf
Notes.
inline is capped for small payloads; large content goes via uri + bytes_sha256.
hhni.dependency_hash is computed over (parent_id, path, tags, content_hash) to detect integrity breaks.
Either embedding.vector or embedding.vector_ref must exist (store vectors where your stack prefers).
27.1.2 Edge (memory relation)
Purpose.
 Typed, weighted links between atoms/molecules; time-sliced; provenance-stamped.

Edge semantics.
contains/is_part_of encode HHNI hierarchy.
relates_to (semantic similarity) is pruned by Adaptive Weight Pruning.
depends_on governs build/order constraints.
derives/supports/contradicts/annotates mirror SEG semantics for cross-linking memory↔evidence.

27.2.2 Core types
seg:Claim
 — a statement the system asserts.
seg:Artifact
 — any intermediate (snippet, summary, code block).
seg:Source
 — external reference (doc, URL, dataset).
seg:ToolCall
 — invocation record (tool id, args hash, result hash).
seg:Decision
 — adjudicated outcome linked to claims/evidence.
seg:Snapshot
 — memory state reference that scoped the run.
seg:Span/Log/Metric
 — operational evidence.

Design notes.
All edges are 
additive
; contradictions are explicit contradicts links (never destructive deletes).
Time-slice
 by validFrom/validTo on any node/edge.
The 
VIF tuple
 on claims and tool calls guarantees replayability.
27.3 ACL — APOE Chain Language AST
Purpose.
 A typed, versioned JSON AST for pipelines/steps/gates/budgets so plans are 
diff-able, testable, and auditable

27.4 Integrity, Indexing, and Performance Notes
Referential integrity
: Edges source_id/target_id must exist in the same snapshot_id (or specify cross-snapshot links with explicit from_snapshot/to_snapshot fields).
Uniqueness
: (source_id, target_id, rel, valid_from) must be unique.
Indices
 (recommended):
Atoms: snapshot_id, modality, hhni.path[*], metrics.rs, tpv.priority.
Edges: snapshot_id, rel, source_id, target_id, valid_from.
Vectors: embedding.vector (cosine) or embedding.vector_ref.
Concurrency
: optimistic writes with etag; server rejects on mismatch.
Compression
: store content_ref.inline_gzip for verbose text; keep bytes_sha256 of raw.
Security
: redact PII at ingest; policy fields propagate to SEG exports.
Calibration
: only the 
reader
 recomputes rs = f(qs, ids, dd); writers should not set rs unless they also provide a VIF for the scoring step.
27.5 Worked Example (Atom + Edge + SEG round-trip)
Write
 a text atom (user prompt → atomized):
{
  "id": "a-7c9c…",
  "schema_version": "1.1.0",
  "kind": "atom",
  "modality": "prompt:user",
  "content_ref": { "inline": "Summarize failed transfers by tip type last week.", "media_type": "text/plain" },
  "embedding": { "model_id": "embed-004", "dim": 768, "vector_ref": "vec:a-7c9c…" },
  "tags": [{ "key": "topic", "value": "payments", "weight": 0.9 }],
  "tpv": { "priority": 0.8, "relevance": 0.87, "decay_tau": 604800 },
  "hhni": { "path": ["system:aiops","section:queries","sentence:12"], "dependency_hash": "5fe1…" },
  "metrics": { "qs": 0.82, "ids": 0.76, "dd": 0.03 },
  "snapshot_id": "S-BF-09D",
  "created_at": "2025-10-17T12:30:01Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-10-17T12:30:01Z",
  "valid_from": "2025-10-17T12:30:01Z",
  "valid_to": null,
  "vif": {
    "model_id": "apoe-gptx-2025-09",
    "weights_hash": "9f2e…",
    "prompt_template_id": "atomize_v3",
    "tool_ids": ["embedder-004"],
    "writer": "agent:archivist"
  },
  "etag": "W/\"e1f-7c3\""
}
Relate
 it to a retrieval artifact with an edge:
{
  "id": "e-22a1…",
  "schema_version": "1.0.0",
  "source_id": "a-7c9c…",
  "target_id": "a-42bd…",
  "rel": "relates_to",
  "weight": 0.87,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "policy": "allowed",
  "reason": "semantic_cosine>=0.85",
  "snapshot_id": "S-BF-09D",
  "created_at": "2025-10-17T12:30:05Z",
  "valid_from": "2025-10-17T12:30:05Z",
  "valid_to": null,
  "vif": { "model_id":"reranker-02","weights_hash":"1cc…","prompt_template_id":"rerank_v2","tool_ids":["vecIndex"],"writer":"agent:retriever" }
}
Emit SEG
 for a claim derived from these atoms; export the JSON-LD bundle as part of the run’s VIF.
27.6 Validation & Tooling
Static validation
: JSON Schema validators (draft 2020-12).
Semantic validation
:
Atom: kind=atom 
⇒
 hhni.parent_id==null or points to molecule.
Edge: rel in {"contains","is_part_of"} 
⇒
 (source.kind, target.kind) is lawful (molecule↔atom rules).
Time: valid_from <= valid_to || valid_to==null.
Canonicalization for hashing
: RFC 8785 (JSON Canonicalization Scheme) before computing bytes_sha256 or root_hash.
Migrations
: store schema_version; supply mappers vN→vN+1 with SEG-logged Decisions.
27.7 Minimal APIs (shape only)
Memory API
POST /atoms (validate + snapshot bind)
POST /edges
GET /atoms/{id}?as_of=… (time-slice)

All 
read-only
 export endpoints include X-Snapshot-Id in headers for replay.
27.8 Checklists

Part XI — Reference Implementations
Chapter 28. APIs — Memory, Orchestration, and Audit (read-only)
Aim. Expose AIMOS/APOE as 
clean, versioned, and provable
 services. This chapter defines endpoint shapes, auth scopes, pagination, filtering, error models, idempotency, and examples. It aligns with the schemas in Ch.27 (Atom/Edge, SEG JSON-LD, ACL AST) and the invariants CMC/APOE/VIF/SEG/SDF-CVF.
28.0 Design goals
Deterministic contracts
 (APOE): typed I/O, explicit budgets, reproducible runs.
Memory-first
 (CMC): snapshot-bound reads/writes; time-sliced queries.
Provenance by default
 (VIF): every mutating call emits a VIF tuple.
Graph substrate
 (SEG): lineage is queryable; contradictions are first-class.
Atomic evolution
 (SDF-CVF): parity gates enforced at API boundaries.
28.1 Base, versions, and auth
Base URL
: https://api.aimos.dev/v1/ (semantic, additive minor versions; breaking changes => v2).
Auth
: OAuth2/OIDC bearer JWT 
or
 mTLS.
Tenancy
: X-Tenant: {org_id} (required).
Scopes
 (minimum set):
Scope
Purpose
aimos.memory.read
Read atoms/edges/snapshots, vector queries
aimos.memory.write
Create/update atoms/edges, open snapshots
aimos.orch.read
Read pipelines, runs, traces
aimos.orch.write
Create/update pipelines, start/cancel runs
aimos.audit.read
Read SEG bundles, VIF tuples, replays (read-only)
28.2 Cross-cutting conventions
Content-Type
: application/json; charset=utf-8 (SEG bundles: application/ld+json).
Idempotency
: Idempotency-Key (UUID v4); server stores 24h hash of request → response.
ETags/optimistic control
: If-Match: W/"etag" on mutable resources.
Time-slicing
: ?as_of=2025-10-17T12:34:56Z or ?from=…&to=….
Pagination
: cursor model — limit (≤ 500), cursor; response includes next_cursor.
Rate limits
: headers X-RateLimit-Limit/Remaining/Reset.
Correlation
: X-Request-Id echoed; also in error bodies and SEG ToolCall nodes.
Error model (uniform):
{
  "error": {
    "code": "MEMORY_INVALID_HHNI",
    "message": "hhni.path must be non-empty and canonical.",
    "status": 400,
    "retryable": false,
    "correlation_id": "req_9b2f…",
    "details": { "field": "hhni.path[0]" }
  }
}
Common codes (subset):
UNAUTHENTICATED, PERMISSION_DENIED, NOT_FOUND, ALREADY_EXISTS,
FAILED_PRECONDITION, INVALID_ARGUMENT, RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED,
ABORTED, CONFLICT, TOO_MANY_REQUESTS, INTERNAL.

: orchestration calls to tools are proxied; tokens are least-privilege and time-boxed; all tool calls are SEG-logged.
Synthetic labeling
: any generated artifact includes machine-readable label fields in SEG (meets synthetic-content labeling duties).
28.12 Checklists
Client integration
Set X-Tenant, X-Request-Id, Idempotency-Key on POST.
Handle next_cursor; stop on absence.
Respect retryable and Backoff-Jitter on 429/503/504.
Send If-Match for updates; handle 412.
Server readiness
Emit VIF tuples for all writes and runs.
Bind writes to a snapshot; closing snapshot computes Merkle root and signature.
Enforce scopes per route; block write verbs on /audit/*.
Uniform error body across services.
Part XI — Reference Implementations
Chapter 29. SDKs & Clients — JS/TS, Python, and CLI
Aim. Give builders 
production-ready client patterns
 for AIMOS/APOE: strict typing, auth, retries with jitter, pagination cursors, idempotency keys, budget headers, and first-class handling of 
VIF/SEG
 artifacts. All examples conform to the API contracts defined in Ch.28.
29.0 Design goals (all SDKs)
Typed by default.
 Request/response models map 1:1 to the schemas in Ch.27/28.
Deterministic retries.
 Exponential backoff with jitter on 429/503/504 and error.retryable=true.
Idempotency.
 Idempotency-Key for all mutating POSTs; safe to retry.
Pagination.
 Cursor pattern with transparent iterators.
Time-slicing.
 as_of / from / to helpers.
Budgets & observability.
 Surface X-Budget-* response headers.
Tenant-scoped.
 Always send X-Tenant.
Error model.
 Uniform mapping to rich exceptions: code, status, correlation_id, details.
Security.
 OAuth2 bearer (or mTLS) injection, zero secret logging.
Environment variables used across examples:
AIMOS_BASE_URL=https://api.aimos.dev/v1

29.4 Testing, mocks, and resilience
JS/TS
: use nock to mock endpoints; assert retry behavior on 429 bursts; verify Idempotency-Key present for POSTs.
Python
: use responses or pytest-httpserver; simulate 503→503→200 sequences; assert backoff timing within tolerance.
Determinism
: seed any randomness (e.g., UUID strategy for e2e tests use fixed keys) when validating idempotency caching.
Budget headers
: capture and expose X-Budget-Tokens-Used, etc., for observability tests.
29.5 Security & compliance hooks
Token providers.
 Allow injection (rotating tokens, STS). Never log tokens; scrub on exceptions.
PII redaction.
 Pre-flight local redaction before POST /atoms; respect server FAILED_PRECONDITION policy_violation=true.
mTLS.
 Optional constructor override for HTTP layer with client certs.
Provenance.
 Surface returned vif on all write responses; provide helpers to attach VIF to downstream artifacts.
29.6 Streaming & large artifacts
Witness “tail”.
 Default pattern uses polling (see 29.1.5/29.2.4). If SSE/WebSocket is enabled by the server, expose runs.subscribe(runId, onEvent) helper that falls back to polling.
Chunked uploads.
 For large content_ref.uri artifacts, prefer object storage + content_ref.uri rather than inlining.
29.7 Cookbook (common tasks)
Vector search within a modality (TS):
await memory.vectorQuery({
  model_id: 'embed-004', k: 25,
  vector: myVec, filters: { modality: 'code:ts', 'tag.repo': 'checkout' }
});
Time-slice read (Py):
latest = http.get('/atoms', as_of='2025-10-17T00:00:00Z')[0]
Idempotent batch ingest (TS):
await Promise.all(payloads.map(p => memory.createAtom(p)));
await memory.closeSnapshot('batch 17');
Lineage export for a claim (Py):
bundle, _ = http.get('/audit/seg/lineage', claim_id='seg:claim:release_rc_0_3',
                     _from='2025-10-10T00:00:00Z', to='2025-10-17T00:00:00Z')
29.8 Versioning & compatibility
Semver packages
 (@aimos/sdk, aimos-sdk).
API drift management.
 SDKs carry generated types from the published OpenAPI (see Ch.28.10). Minor server changes are additive; breaking changes bump v2 base URL and @aimos/sdk@2.x.
Feature flags.
 Expose booleans for optional endpoints (e.g., SSE witness) with graceful degradation.
29.9 Client checklists
Initialization
AIMOS_BASE_URL, AIMOS_TENANT, AIMOS_TOKEN configured.
Per-service timeouts set (connect/read).
User agent string identifies your app.
Reliability

Chapter 30. Retrieval Math — RS/QS/IDS/DD definitions, normalization, calibration, and UQ theory
Aim. Specify the retrieval scoring family used by AIMOS/APOE; prove its monotonicity/bounds; define normalization and calibration to map scores to probabilities; and formalize uncertainty quantification (UQ) for gating (κ) and orchestration budgets.

30.1 RS/QS/IDS/DD — definitions & bounds
30.1.1 Quality score 
Decomposed into 
completeness
, 
specificity
, and 
semantic alignment
, with temporal hygiene:
: fraction of query intents covered by 
(from intent graph).
: inverse breadth (e.g., 
).
: normalized similarity (e.g., cosine of query/atom embeddings, reranked by cross-encoder if available).
, 
. Clip 
to 
.
Monotonicity
: 
increases with 
, 
, 
; non-increasing in 
.
30.1.2 Indexing-depth score 
Measures 
how deeply and cleanly
 the content is positioned in HHNI:
: number of resolvable sub-indices (system→…→sub-word) beneath/around 
.
: local connection density quality (weighted by tag precision, not raw degree).
: share of the relevant section hierarchy with valid links.
: inconsistency penalty (dangling hashes, orphan edges).
. Output is in 
via 
.
Intuition
: Deep, well-connected, and consistent items score higher.
30.1.3 Dependency-delta 
Risk that using 
breaks or contradicts
 existing commitments:
: neighboring edges/nodes (dependencies) in SEG/HHNI.
: change in key tag vectors vs. last accepted snapshot.
Hard contradictions raise 
sharply (binary bump).
is perfectly safe; 
is unusable without quarantine/HITL.
Monotonicity
: 
increases with conflicts and drift.
30.1.4 Retrieval score 
Compositional
 and 
bounded
:
Bounds
: product of three 
terms 
⇒
 
.
Sensitivity
: 
;
;
.
Interpretation
: high quality + deep index 
unless
 the dependency risk is high.
30.2 Normalization & calibration
We must convert raw scores to 
well-calibrated probabilities
 usable for κ-gating and budgets.
30.2.1 Score normalization
Bring heterogenous components to a comparable scale before product:
Z-score within slice
 (modality/tenant/time):
.
Quantile map
 to 
: 
.
Affine clip
 for stability: 
.
We normalize 
into 
before composing 
.
30.2.2 Probability calibration
Map 
(or a feature vector) to 
with held-out labels 
.
a) Platt / Logistic calibration (binary):
Fit 
on validation data minimizing log-loss; optionally L2-penalize.
b) Isotonic regression (non-parametric):
Monotone stepwise function 
s.t. 
. Better when score–probability relation is non-linear.
c) Multi-feature calibration:
Use 
slice-aware
 models (per modality/domain) to avoid leakage and improve fairness.
d) Temperature scaling (for classifier logits):
For cross-encoder logits 
: 
, fitted on a dev set.
Calibration metrics:
 Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Brier score, reliability curves.
Acceptance
: ECE ≤ 0.04 on primary slices; Brier ≤ baseline-5%.
30.3 Uncertainty theory (UQ) for retrieval & chains
We quantify 
aleatoric
 (inherent ambiguity) and 
epistemic
 (model ignorance).
30.3.1 Pointwise uncertainty
Predictive entropy
: 
.
Ensemble variance
: multiple models or seeds 
,
.
Temperature sweep stability
: stddev across 
.
Combine into a 
UQ vector
 
and a scalar risk index:
30.3.2 Conformal coverage (optional guarantees)
Split-conformal for retrieval thresholds:
Define nonconformity 
.
On calibration set 
, pick quantile 
of 
.
At inference, accept if 
⇒
 marginal coverage 
.
This yields 
finite-sample
 control of false accepts under exchangeability.
30.3.3 Chain-level UQ (APOE)
For a chain using items 
with pairwise dependence small:
Law of total variance
 aggregation (approximate):
Min-confidence heuristic
 for safety gates:
Gate if 
or

Part XII — Mathematics & Formal Methods
Chapter 31. Dynamics — GODN potentials & forces, convergence sketches, stability regions
Scope.
 This chapter specifies the continuous and discrete-time dynamics used by the Graviton Organic Dynamics Network (GODN): the potential energy model, force laws, integrators, convergence conditions, stability regions, and practical parameter regimes. These definitions are aligned with the GODN reference you provided and are specialized here for AIMOS/APOE (DVNS/HHNI) retrieval and orchestration. 
Graviton Organic Dynamic Network
31.1 State, potentials, and units
State variables (per node 
i
):
 position 
, velocity 
, mass 
. Distances 
, unit vector 
.
Total energy.
with
Parameters: gravitational constant 
, barrier stiffness 
, bond stiffness 
, perimeter distance 
, bond equilibrium 
, bond set 
. (Matches the reference’s gravity, elastic perimeter, holding terms.) 
Graviton Organic Dynamic Network
Damping (Rayleigh).
 Linear velocity damping with coefficient 
.
Non-dimensionalization (for tuning):
 choose a length scale 
, time scale 
, mass scale 
. Define 
, 
, 
. Natural dimensionless groups:
Gravity–elastic ratio
 
(collapse tendency).
Bond–barrier stiffness ratio
 
(cluster rigidity).
Damping ratio
 
(effective local second-order behavior).
31.2 Forces and equations of motion
For each pair 
:
Net force: 
. Dynamics: 
. (As summarized in the GODN framework.) 
Graviton Organic Dynamic Network
31.3 Integrators (energy behavior & recommendations)
Symplectic Euler (semi-implicit).
Pros: simple, stable for stiff contact-like terms, modest energy drift. Good default for online DVNS refinement.
Velocity-Verlet.
Pros: second-order, near-symplectic; use when energy fidelity matters (e.g., precomputation/offline).
Adaptive time-step.
If 
small (near equilibrium), increase step (fast-forward); near high-curvature events (close approaches, bond snaps), decrease step. (Matches GODN’s time scaling guidance.) 
Graviton Organic Dynamic Network
Guideline:
 begin with symplectic Euler, clamp 
by local Lipschitz estimate of forces; switch to Velocity-Verlet in offline precompute of super-index fields.
31.4 Convergence sketches (with damping and gates)
Energy descent with damping.
 For fixed 
and 
, continuous-time dynamics satisfy
Thus 
is a Lyapunov function and decreases monotonically to a (possibly local) minimum. In discrete time, if 
is small enough (CFL-like bound below), the numerical scheme preserves practical descent (non-increasing 
except for 
jitter). (Consistent with the doc’s energy-minimization loop.) 
Graviton Organic Dynamic Network
Stopping conditions (APOE gate compatible).
for 
consecutive steps, 
and
max speed 
, 
and
topology stable (no bond/perimeter events over 
steps).
Abstention trigger (κ):
 if energy fails to descend or oscillates beyond 
iterations, emit 
and route to a safer parameter regime (reduce 
, increase 
, or raise 
).
31.5 Stability regions & parameter regimes
We characterize qualitative regimes by three axes:
Collapse vs. dispersion (gravity vs. barrier).
Define 
.
Dispersion region:
 
→ repulsion dominates, nodes maintain spacing; good for 
policy-aware retrieval
 (no cluster collapse).
Balanced clustering:
 
–
 → soft clusters, emergent paths without singular collapse (DVNS sweet spot).
Collapse-prone:
 
→ dense cores; only safe with strong 
and nonzero 
bonds.
Rigidity vs. fluidity (bond vs. barrier).
.
Low 
: fluid clusters, easier path re-routing, risk of jitter.
Mid 
(0.5–5): elastic but stable clusters; recommended.
High 
: rigid lattices; can trap in suboptimal shapes.
Damping ratio (oscillation control).
Local second-order modes exhibit under/critical/over-damped behavior governed by 
.
: faster convergence but overshoot/oscillation risk.
: robust, monotone settling; recommended for online.
: slow but safest near constraints.
Discrete-time CFL-like bound (rule of thumb).
Pick tighter step if close approaches are frequent (TSP cluster stitching, protein contacts). These prescriptions follow the reference’s “stability and scalability” and “dynamic parameter” guidance. 
Graviton Organic Dynamic Network
31.6 Fast force evaluation (scaling)
Naïve pairwise forces are 
. Use:
Cutoffs & neighbor lists
 for repulsion/holding (short-range).
Barnes–Hut / FMM
 for gravity (approximate far-field, 
).
Uniform grids
 in 2D/3D TSP-like tasks for near-field search.
These preserve the emergent behavior while scaling to large HHNI/DVNS corpora. (The GODN doc emphasizes scalability via localized computations.) 
Graviton Organic Dynamic Network
31.7 Mapping to DVNS/HHNI retrieval
Positions from embeddings.
 Let 
be normalized embedding vectors. Use angular distance 
(or 
). Forces then act along 
(the geodesic gradient direction). Practical simplification: embed to 
, normalize, treat distances as Euclidean locally.
Policy-aware geometry.
 Mark forbidden regions (privacy, license) as 
hard perimeters
: set a high 
and small 
buffer around restricted sets; DVNS will not cross them (forces push trajectories away).
Adaptive masses.
 Let 
(from CMC/HHNI). Use decay 
for stale nodes (the doc’s “mass adjustment”).

too small → raise 
, increase

.
Oscillation/limit cycles:
 
with large 
→ increase 
, reduce 
, switch to symplectic Euler.
Fragmentation (no paths):
 barriers too strong or 
too weak → lower 
or raise 
/
.
Stall (no convergence):
 poor step control near contacts → adaptive 
, neighbor cutoffs, reorder force eval.
Policy breach risk:
 ensure forbidden regions have 
hard perimeters
 and that APOE gates check crossings before commit.
31.10 Algorithm sketch (discrete iteration)

repeat
  // neighbor discovery (short-range) and far-field approx (gravity)
  for i: F_i = -c_d * v_i
  for pairs (i,j) in near-list:
      F_i += F_grav(i,j) + F_rep(i,j) + F_hold(i,j)
      F_j -= (same)
  for far clusters: add Barnes–Hut gravity contributions
  // integrate (symplectic Euler)
  v_i += (F_i / m_i) * Δt
  x_i += v_i * Δt
  // adaptive dt & event handling
  if (close-approach or bond event) reduce Δt; else maybe increase
  // check convergence gates (ΔE, max|v|, topology stable)
until gates pass or κ-abstain
31.11 Worked intuitions (three canonical tasks)
TSP-like retrieval:
 gravity pulls semantically close cities into clusters; barrier keeps tour from self-intersecting; bonds stitch cluster frontiers; damping yields a clean loop. (Doc’s TSP example.) 
Graviton Organic Dynamic Network
Protein-like folding:
 hydrophobic cores via gravity, steric clash avoided by perimeters, secondary-structure bonds as 
springs; adaptive mass highlights catalytic residues. 
Graviton Organic Dynamic Network
Galaxy-like super-indexing:
 super-dense knowledge regions act as high-mass attractors; arms form along semantic manifolds; dynamic focus zooms dense cores. 
Graviton Organic Dynamic Network
31.12 What to log (for VIF/SEG)
Per run: 
, integrator, neighbor/cutoff scheme, seeds, energy trace 
, gate outcomes, κ events, and the mapping from nodes to artifacts (snapshot ids). This makes each emergent configuration 
witnessable
 and 
replayable
 inside SEG.
Takeaway.
 GODN’s simple potential—gravity + elastic perimeter + holding—combined with damping and careful integration yields a robust, tunable engine for emergent organization. With the stability map 
, adaptive time/mass, and policy-aware perimeters, AIMOS/APOE can run DVNS at scale while remaining verifiable and safe.

31.2 Forces
, 
31.3 Convergence Proof Sketches
, and 
31.4 Stability Regions
. It refines and extends the earlier high-level write-up with tighter definitions, optional smoothings, and explicit conditions you can implement and test.
31.2 Forces — full specification & implementation notes
31.2.1 State and notation
Nodes 
with position 
, velocity

.
Pair geometry: 
, 
(for

Parameter set 
:
: gravity strength.
: barrier/perimeter stiffness (short-range repulsion).
: bond stiffness for pairs in 
(the “holding set”).
: perimeter distance (minimum comfortable separation).
: bond equilibrium distance.
: linear (Rayleigh) damping.
31.2.2 Potentials and canonical forces (piecewise)

Conservative pair forces are 
(equal and opposite on 
):
Damping: 
.
Net force: 
.
Equations of motion (continuous time).
31.2.3 Smooth, differentiable alternatives (for robust autodiff)
The piecewise barrier can introduce kinks at 
. For differentiable pipelines (e.g., learning 
or embedding–force co-training), prefer a smooth approximation:
Soft barrier (softplus-squared):
Let 
. Define 
.
Then 
with 
.
Softened gravity (Plummer-like):
Replace 
with 
(small 
), limiting forces at very small 
.
Bond windowing:
Multiply the bond term by a smooth gate 
to avoid stiff snaps when bonds appear/disappear.
These smoothings preserve intent (attraction/repulsion/holding) while improving gradient stability.
31.2.4 Embedding-space forces for DVNS/HHNI
In DVNS retrieval, positions come from normalized embeddings 
. Two pragmatic constructions:
Euclidean proxy.
 Work in 
with 
normalized, distance 
. Forces as above with 
defined in the ambient space.
Angular metric.
 Use 
as “distance”. For a potential 
, the force in the tangent space is:
with 
. In practice, we often adopt the Euclidean proxy for speed and simplicity, reserving angular corrections for offline precomputation.
31.3 Convergence proof sketches (continuous & discrete; with events)
31.3.1 Continuous-time gradient–damped system
Define the conservative force 
. With damping 
(
), the dynamics are
Lyapunov descent.
 Consider 
. Then
Hence 
is non-increasing, bounded below (by construction), and thus converges. By LaSalle’s invariance principle, the trajectories approach the largest invariant set where 
and 
, i.e., a (possibly local) equilibrium of 
.
With smooth barriers/bonds.
 If the potentials are 
(soft variants above), the same Lyapunov argument holds globally.
With piecewise barriers/bonds.
 The system is a 
hybrid
 (switched) dynamical system with discrete “events” (enter/exit perimeter, bond on/off). Between events, the Lyapunov argument holds. At an event, energy may jump 
up
 or 
down
 depending on how the event function is implemented:
If bonds are activated only when it 
reduces
 energy (or under a “no-increase” policy), 
remains non-increasing.
If bonds/perimeters enforce 
projections
 that do not increase 
(e.g., snapping to the nearest feasible manifold), 
remains non-increasing.
Conclusion (sketch).
 With 
and a “no-increase” event policy, the continuous system converges to a closed set of equilibria; generically, to a local minimum (modulo plateaus/saddles).
31.3.2 Discrete-time integration (semi-implicit Euler / Velocity-Verlet)
Let 
be the step.
Semi-implicit (symplectic) Euler
For a quadratic well, this scheme is energy-stable for sufficiently small 
and 
. In our mixed potentials, 
practical descent
 holds if:
satisfies a CFL-like bound w.r.t. local stiffness (below),
damping is non-zero,
events are handled by “no-increase” policies.
Velocity-Verlet
 is second-order and near-symplectic. With linear damping (handled via splitting or exponential integrators), it exhibits smaller long-term drift. Use it in offline precompute or when energy fidelity matters.
Step-size bound (rule-of-thumb).
 Let 
. A stable 
satisfies
where 
is a characteristic length and 
a characteristic mass. In practice, we 
adapt 
downwards when (i) any 
is near a barrier or (ii) a bond event is imminent.
Stopping gates (deterministic APOE-compatible).
 Stop when
If not satisfied by 
iterations, 
abstain
 (
) and re-run with safer parameters (↓
, ↑
, ↑
).
31.3.3 Local optimality and saddles
At a fixed event pattern (no switching), equilibria satisfy 
. The Hessian 
determines local type:
Positive-definite 
:
 strict local minimum (preferred).
Indefinite 
:
 saddle; small perturbations or stochasticity help escape.
Near-singular 
:
 flat directions; increase 
or 
slightly to regularize.
With damping, noisy embeddings, or small stochastic kicks, systems typically leave saddles and settle into local minima.
31.4 Stability regions — maps, regimes, and tuning playbook
31.4.1 Dimensionless groups (for portable tuning)
Choose scales 
(length), 
(mass). Define:
Gravity–barrier ratio
Small 
→ barrier dominates (spread out); large 
→ collapse risk.
Bond–barrier stiffness ratio
Low 
→ fluid clusters (easy re-route), high 
→ rigid clusters (may trap).
Damping ratio
 (local second-order surrogate)
with 
from local curvature (barrier/bond) and 
a typical mass.
31.4.2 Qualitative phase map
Dispersion region
 (
):
Repulsion dominates; nodes maintain spacing; good for 
policy-aware retrieval
 and safe navigation (no collapses), but can fragment (add mild 
or bonds to “thread” paths).
Balanced clustering
 (
):
Soft clusters and emergent “lanes”. 
DVNS sweet spot
 for forming stable retrieval paths without singular cores.
Collapse-prone
 (
):
Strong attraction; requires higher 
, hard perimeters, and bond guidance. Use only for “galaxy” super-indexing or precompute, not online navigation.
Stiffness ratio 
:
: elastic and steerable clusters (recommended).
: jitter; increase damping or barrier.
: rigid lattices; risk of suboptimal traps.
Damping 
:
: monotone settling (recommended online).
: faster but oscillatory; combine with adaptive 
.
: very safe, may be slow; good for sensitive policy zones.
31.4.3 Numerical stability (time-step and events)
Use 
adaptive 
with multiplicative factors (e.g., ×0.5 on close approach; ×1.1 when calm).
Enforce 
minimum separation
 
(tiny 
) or softened gravity to avoid blow-ups.
Handle 
events
 (perimeter/bond transitions) with a 
no-increase
 energy policy; if violated, roll back one substep and re-attempt with smaller 
or softened parameter locally.

Minimal checklist for implementation
Forces
: implement conservative forces + damping; optional smooth variants.
Integrator
: start with semi-implicit Euler + adaptive 
; consider Velocity-Verlet offline.
Gates
: energy descent, velocity cap, topology stability; κ-abstain on failure.
Params
: target 
for online DVNS.
Events
: “no-increase” policy; rollback on violation.
Safety
: hard perimeters for policy zones; minimum separation; softened gravity.
This addendum gives you the mathematically disciplined backbone you need to run GODN inside DVNS/HHNI confidently—stable, tunable, and auditable.
Part XII — Mathematics & Formal Methods
Chapter 31. Dynamics
31.1 GODN Potentials & Forces (recap + formalization)
We model each node 
(atom, tag, step, document, etc.) as a particle with mass 
, position 
, and velocity 
. Pairs interact through 
attractive
 (semantic “gravity”), 
repulsive/elastic
 (collision & structure), and 
holding
 (soft constraints) terms; plus 
viscous damping
 for dissipation.
Let 
, 
, 
with a small 
to avoid division by zero.
Potential energy (pairwise + unary):
: set of 
structural
 edges we want to keep near rest-length 
(e.g., hierarchy or typed dependency).
: set of 
forbidden
 sets (guardrails), enforced by convex barriers 
(e.g., large penalty near disallowed subspaces).
Softened gravity prevents singular collapse; hard-core repulsion prevents overlap; springs preserve HHNI/SEG geometry.
Forces (negative gradient):
with 
the viscous damping. Expanded pairwise terms (omitting indicators and barriers for brevity):
Continuous-time dynamics (second order with damping):
Discrete-time integrators
 (used by DVNS/online re-ranking):
Symplectic/Velocity-Verlet (recommended):
 stable for stiff springs if 
respects CFL bounds (below).
Explicit Euler:
 simple but small 
region; we use it only for analysis/fallback.
Projected step:
 after each update, project 
onto feasible set to respect policy geometry 
.
31.2 Convergence — proof sketches
We establish that (a) 
energy decays
 under damping, (b) the flow 
converges to critical points
 of 
, and (c) with mild curvature conditions those points are 
local minima
 (no oscillatory failure). We then lift to the discrete setting with step-size bounds.
Lemma 31.2.1 (Energy decay, continuous time)

Every

Sketch.
 If

Proposition 31.2.3 (Convergence to local minima under PL/gradient–dominance)
Assume 
is 
-smooth (Lipschitz gradient) and satisfies a 
Polyak–Łojasiewicz (PL)
 inequality in a neighborhood of the set of minimizers 
:
Then the damped dynamics converge to 
and 
at least linearly in energy gap.
Sketch.
 Standard heavy-ball/gradient flow arguments: PL yields energy–gradient coupling; damping kills kinetic energy; LaSalle’s invariance principle finishes.
Design note.
 Our potentials are sums of 
attractive kernels with softening
 plus 
convex repulsive/constraint
 terms. In practice this yields a landscape that is (piecewise) 
gradient-dominated
 around desired configurations (clusters at rest-lengths, no overlaps), satisfying the PL condition locally.
Discrete-time convergence (Velocity-Verlet with damping)
Consider Velocity-Verlet with step 
:
Theorem 31.2.4 (Energy stability region, linearized)
Linearize around a strict local minimum

Moreover, with damping, the 
discrete energy
 decays for sufficiently small 
(proof via modified energy / backward error analysis).

Pick
to ensure practical decay and avoid ringing.
Projected & constrained dynamics
With barriers 
and post-step 
projection
 
onto convex feasible 
(policy geometry), we obtain 
Fejér monotonicity
 to 
and retain energy decay up to projection residuals. Standard projected heavy-ball analysis yields convergence to a KKT point of 
under the same step bounds.
31.3 Stability regions — parameter maps & operational rules
We now chart parameter regimes 
that guarantee 
no collapse
, 
no oscillation
, and 
fast settling
.
31.3.1 Spectral stiffness & natural frequencies
Let 
be the Hessian. Near any stable configuration 
,
Large 
(tight structure springs) and 
large 
(hard core) increase 
⇒
 
reduce allowable

Softening 
reduces curvature of the gravity kernel at short distances 
⇒
 
increases

Rule R1 (CFL bound).
 Measure/estimate 
(or upper bound via Gershgorin/diag dominance). Choose
31.3.2 Damping regimes
For a scalar damped mode 
, define 
.
Underdamped
 
: oscillatory; fast but may ring.
Critically damped
 
: fastest non-oscillatory approach.
Overdamped
 
: monotone but slower.
Rule R2 (critical-ish damping).
 Target per-mode 
. Operationally,
where 
is local effective stiffness seen by node 
(sum of adjacent spring curvatures + local Hessian contribution from gravity/repulsion).
31.3.3 Anti-collapse & anti-crowding
Softening (

This ensures gravity cannot overpower short-range stabilization.
Rule R3 (no-collapse margin).
 Monitor minimum distance 
; if 
, automatically increase 
or decrease 
by 10–20% and restart the current micro-iteration (abstain if repeats).
31.3.4 Discrete stability charts (per integrator)
Velocity-Verlet + damping:

semantic path/cluster
 on top-k candidates; no ringing 
⇒

Policy-aware geometry.
 Projection ensures 
forbidden crossings
 (guardrails) are respected, turning instability into 
abstention
 rather than silent failure.
Budget coupling.
 Adaptive step ties naturally to token/time budgets: when energy trends poorly, tighten step or early-stop with a VIF note.
31.3.7 Practical defaults (good starting priors)

31.3.8 What can go wrong (and how we prevent it)
Mode coupling & chatter.
 Too small 
or too large 
→ oscillations. 
Mitigation:

Cluster collapse.
 Gravity dominates at short range. 
Mitigation:

 Large projections each step. 
Mitigation:
 increase damping, reduce 
, or relax/rest-length 
.
Discrete drift.

Part XII — Mathematics & Formal Methods
Chapter 32. Type Systems & Logic — ACL types & effects, symbolic checkers, soundness notes
Objective: make orchestration 
legible, checkable, and safe
 before it runs. ACL’s type-and-effect discipline guarantees that plans are well-formed, budget-bounded, policy-lawful, and witness-producing by construction.
32.0 Overview
What we type-check:
 pipelines, steps, tools, models, gates, budgets, and evidence emissions.
What we prove:
 (i) no missing inputs, (ii) no illegal capabilities, (iii) budgets won’t underflow, (iv) every boundary emits VIF + UQ, (v) optional information-flow safety, (vi) determinism flags when claimed.
How we do it:
 a 
type-and-effect
 system with 
budget indices
 and 
capability tokens
, plus symbolic constraints discharged by SMT/SHACL/Datalog checkers.
32.1 ACL kinds & types
32.1.1 Kinds
* — value types (data)
cap — capability kinds (authority to act)
ε — effect rows (latent side effects)
idx — budget indices (compile-time naturals / intervals)
32.1.2 Base value types (*)
Text, Bytes, JSON, YAML, UUID, Time, URL, Path
Score (0..1), Tokens (int), Seconds (float), Energy (float)
Embedding[d] (fixed dimension d)
Atom, Molecule, Edge, SnapshotId
Claim, Evidence, Witness, UQVec (all carry VIF metadata)
Graph (SEG slice), HL7, PDF, Parquet (domain wrappers)
32.1.3 Parametric data types
List[T], Option[T], Map[K,V], Stream[T]
Gate[T] (a check producing a Witness for T)
Budget (phantom-typed: Budget[tokens:idx, secs:idx])
Result[Ok, Err]
32.1.4 Roles & tools
Role = Planner | Retriever | Reasoner | Verifier | Builder | Critic | Operator | Witnesser
Model[id, temp:idx, top_p:idx]
Tool[name, caps:cap] (e.g., caps = {net[domain], fs[scope], seg[mode]})
32.1.5 Capabilities (kind cap)
mem = read_mem | write_mem
seg = seg_read | seg_write
net[domain], fs[scope], exec[lang], llm[provider]
No ambient authority
: capabilities are 
linear tokens
 consumed or re-scoped at call sites.
32.1.6 Effects (kind ε)
Effect rows describe latent side effects a step may perform:
ε ::= {} 
    | ε 
∪
 { ReadMem | WriteMem | CallLLM | CallTool[t] 
          | Net[domain] | File[scope] | SEG[mode] 
          | Time | Random | Abstain[κ] | Emit[VIF] }
Row polymorphism allows steps to 
add
 effects; composition 
joins
 rows.
32.1.7 Refinements (lightweight dependent predicates)
Any base/parametric type may be refined with guards:
Tokens{n ≥ 0}, Score{0 ≤ s ≤ 1}, Embedding[d]{norm≤1}
Claim{has_lineage}, Budget{tokens≤T 
∧
 secs
≤
S}
32.2 ACL typing surfaces
We write judgments as:
: value environment (names → types)
: refinement constraints (SMT-discharged)
: capability context (linear multiset of tokens)
: ACL term (pipeline, step, call…)
: result type
: latent effect row
: 
budget summary
 (tokens/sec upper bounds)
Key constructs:
Step:
 step name : (In) -> (Out) when Gate using Tool with Budget
Pipeline:
 p1 |> p2 (seq), p1 || p2 (parallel), route on pred { … }
Gate:
 assertions g_spec, g_tests, g_trace, g_safety, producing Witness
Emit:
 emit_vif(meta) obligation at boundaries
32.3 Core typing & composition rules (selected)
(VAR)
If 
, then 
.

Literals have ground types with empty effects and zero budget.

(SEQ)
Sequential composition accumulates effects and adds budgets 
monoidally

Capabilities flow linearly:

Parallel branches sum budgets and

 ε2) 
▷
 (B1

(ROUTE)
All branches must 
type-agree

weighted joins
 by static branch coverage bounds or worst-case:

 if preconditions cannot be proved or UQ exceeds risk bands:
Γ; Φ

κ
}
———————————————
Γ; Φ; Δ 
⊢
 abstain(
κ
) : Result[T,Abstain] ! {Abstain[κ], Emit[VIF]} 
▷
 0
32.4 Budgets as indexed types
We track resource 
potential
 at compile-time:
Budget[t:idx, s:idx] with monoid 
:
.
Subtyping: Budget[t1,s1] <: Budget[t2,s2] iff 
.
Each LLM/tool rule 
consumes
 a bounded slice; the checker ensures final total ≤ declared pipeline budget.
This yields 
amortized resource analysis
: if it type-checks, runtime cannot exceed the budget unless a tool violates its contract (then the runtime raises Overbudget with VIF).
32.5 Information-flow & policy logic (optional layer)
Security labels:
 Low ≤…≤ High; types lifted to T@ℓ.
Noninterference:
 well-typed plan prevents High→Low leaks except through 
declassified gates
 with Witness{policy}.
Policy logic:
 Datalog/OPA-style rules over VIF + SEG (e.g., “no seg_write to external tenant without HITL witness”). Violations become 
unsatisfied proof obligations
 during checking.
32.6 Symbolic checkers (toolchain)
Type/Effect/Budget checker (ACL-TC).
Linear capability accounting; row-polymorphic effects; budget addition; refinement constraints to SMT (Z3).
Outputs: typed AST, global effect row, budget ceiling, 
obligation set
.
Gate satisfiability (SMT).
Proves predicates used by g_spec, g_tests, g_tags, g_trace, g_safety.
Unprovable → plan refuses to compile unless an Abstain[κ] arm exists.
SEG/JSON-LD validator (SHACL).
Ensures lineage graphs satisfy shape constraints (nodes, edges, temporal validity).
Determinism checker.
Flags nondeterministic sources (Random, Time, CallLLM with temp>τ, external net) unless bound behind Verifier gates with stabilization (e.g., temperature sweep + tie-break).
Policy/Datalog engine.
Confirms capability use matches policy; produces human-readable “why allowed” proof trace.
32.7 Soundness theorems (informal but precise)
Theorem 32.7.1 (Progress).
If 
and all external tools/models are available, then 
either
 
or
 
(a reduction step exists) 
or
 
with Witness{reason}.
Theorem 32.7.2 (Preservation).
If 
and 
, then 
with 
and 
(budgets don’t grow; effects don’t appear from nowhere). Capability multiset evolves linearly.
Theorem 32.7.3 (Budget safety).
For any well-typed plan, at runtime cumulative tokens/seconds 
do not exceed
 static Budget unless a tool violates its contract; such violations surface as Overbudget errors carrying VIF of the offender.
Theorem 32.7.4 (Lineage totality).
Every boundary (plan start/end; tool/LLM call; gate) in a well-typed trace produces a Witness that links artifacts to inputs/tools/snapshots, ensuring VIF completeness.
Theorem 32.7.5 (Noninterference, optional).
If a plan type-checks under labels and has no declassify edges, then changes to High inputs cannot alter Low outputs (modulo Abstain), i.e., confidentiality holds.
Sketches:
 all via induction on typing derivations and small-step operational semantics for ACL; budget safety leverages potential-style indices; noninterference follows classic security typing.
32.8 Checker architecture & complexity
Pass 1:
 kinding, name resolution, role/capability binding (linear).
Pass 2:
 type/effect inference with capability linearity (near-linear in |AST|).
Pass 3:
 budget aggregation (monoid fold).
Pass 4:
 obligations to solvers:
SMT (refinements/gates): worst-case NP-hard; in practice small and cached.
SHACL (SEG shapes): linear in graph size.
Datalog policy: polynomial; incremental.
Artifacts:
 typed AST; effect summary; budget table; solver proofs; 
witness-carrying plan
 ready for execution.
32.9 Worked example (derivation sketch)
Plan:
 retrieve → (reason || verify) → merge → emit.
step retrieve : Query -> List[Atom] 
  using Tool["vecstore", caps={seg_read}] 
  with Budget[tokens=0, secs≤0.2]
step reason : List[Atom] -> Draft
  using Model["gpt-x", temp=0.2] 
  with Budget[tokens≤8k, secs≤3]
step verify : Draft -> Verdict×Witness
  using Tool["lint", caps={exec[js]}] 
  with Budget[0, secs≤0.5]
step merge : (Draft×Verdict) -> Answer×Witness
  gate(g_spec 
∧
 g_trace 
∧
 g_safety)
Typing facts (selected):
retrieve effects {SEG[read]} 
▷
 (0,
≤
0.2)
reason effects {CallLLM, Emit[VIF]} 
▷
 (
≤
8k,
≤
3)
verify effects {CallTool["lint"], Emit[VIF]} 
▷
 (0,
≤
0.5)
Parallel reason || verify: budgets sum → (≤8k, ≤3.5); effects union.
merge requires gate proofs → emits Witness.
Whole pipeline summary:
Type: Query -> Answer×Witness
Effects: {SEG[read], CallLLM, CallTool["lint"], Emit[VIF]}
Budget ceiling: Tokens≤8k, Secs≤3.7
Determinism: flagged 
non-deterministic
 unless verify stabilizes (e.g., temperature sweep + tie-break); checker suggests mitigations.
32.10 Diagnostic strategy
Missing capability:
 “call(tool) requires seg_write; have seg_read.”
Budget under-spec:
 “call_llm needs Tokens≥12 345; declared ≤8 000.”
Unwitnessed boundary:
 “merge lacks Emit[VIF] — add gate(g_trace) or emit_vif.”
Policy violation:
 “net[external] forbidden without HITL proof (Policy §7.2).”
Determinism claim failed:
 “source of nondeterminism: CallLLM(temp=0.8); add verifier or relax claim.”
Each error includes 
fix-its
 and links to the violated rule.
32.11 Soundness notes & limitations
Model/tool contracts
 are assumed correct; breakage is caught at runtime with VIF.
Budgets
 are upper bounds; real usage may be lower; we treat tool slack as OK.
Refinements
 are only as strong as predicates and solver timeouts; we cache and bound.
Parallelism
 assumes no shared mutable state beyond typed capabilities.
32.12 Implementation notes
Front-end:
 EBNF from Ch.13 extended with type annotations and with Budget[…] clauses.
Middle-end:
 Hindley–Milner + effect rows + linear capabilities; interval arithmetic for indices; global fold for budgets.
Back-end:
SMT (Z3/CVC5) for refinements & gates
SHACL for SEG payloads
Datalog/OPA for policies
Artifacts written to SEG:
 type cert, effect summary, budget cert, policy proof — bound to snapshot id.
Outcome:
 ACL’s type-and-effect discipline turns 
plans into proofs
: if it compiles, it respects capabilities, budgets, and provenance duties by construction. That is the core of 
APOE’s reliability
 and the substrate upon which 
VIF
 and 
SEG
 become operational rather than aspirational.

Objective: make AIMOS/APOE a 
living, accountable
 project where ideas become 
witnessed decisions
, contributions evolve 
atomically
, and community trust is earned through 
transparent process
.
34.0 Scope & principles
Memory-native community:
 every decision is an artifact (ADR/RFC) with 
VIF
 and a link into the 
SEG
.
Atomic evolution:
 code/docs/tags/traces change 
together
 (SDF-CVF).
Safety-first:
 abstention, redaction, and HITL are 
policies
, not suggestions.
Open by default, governed by evidence:
 lazy consensus for low risk; two-key for high risk.
34.1 Contribution model
Repos & branches
main (protected, signed, green-only), develop (integration), feature branches feat/*, hotfix fix/*.
CODEOWNERS
 required for memory, orchestration, and audit packages.
All PRs must include: linked issue, 
witness
 (VIF JSON), 
gates
 status (tests/spec/tags/trace/safety).
Labels
Risk tiers: risk:R0 (docs), R1 (low), R2 (med), R3 (high).
Areas: area:cmc, area:dvns, area:apoe, area:vif, area:seg, area:ide, area:security.
Outcomes: needs-adr, needs-rfc, needs-hitl, quarantined.
Decision flow
Idea → Issue → 
RFC
 (design options) → 
ADR
 (chosen option) → PR(s) → Merge (if gates green) → Release note.
High-risk (R2/R3): 
two-key
 reviewers (domain owner + safety owner); human-in-the-loop sign-off recorded in 
SEG
.
34.2 ADRs — templates & process
When to write an ADR
Anything that changes an interface, storage schema, ACL semantics, security posture, or compliance behavior.
Anything a future maintainer would need to 
understand or challenge
.
ADR lifecycle
Proposed → Accepted → Superseded or Rejected.
Every ADR gets a 
SEG node
 with edges to the PRs, tests, and benchmarks that evidence it.
ADR Template (docs/adr/XXXX-title.md)

34.4 Review rotations & decision rules
Rotations
Weekly 
area-based
 rotations: CMC, DVNS, APOE, VIF/SEG, Security, IDE/DX.
Each PR auto-assigns 
one area reviewer
 + 
one safety reviewer
 (capability owner).
Load balancing: max 5 active PRs per reviewer; auto-reassign on breach.
Decision rules
Lazy consensus
 (R0/R1): merge if no substantive objections in 48h and gates green.
Two-key approval
 (R2/R3): domain + safety must approve; HITL record attached (SEG).
Escalation:
 unresolved after 5 business days → TSC vote (simple majority).
RACI
Responsible:
 PR author; 
Accountable:
 area owner; 
Consulted:
 safety, compliance; 
Informed:
 release manager.
34.5 Governance structure
TSC (Technical Steering Committee):
 area leads + security lead + PM.
Charter:
 uphold invariants (CMC/APOE/VIF/SDF-CVF/SEG), arbitrate disputes, freeze plans for releases, own roadmap.
Decision log:
 TSC decisions are 
ADRs
 with Decision scope.
34.6 Ethics & use policies (AUP)
Core principles
Transparency:
 machine-readable provenance by default.
Minimality:
 collect, store, and expose 
only
 what is necessary.
User agency:
 opt-outs for data reuse; meaningful consent.
Safety over speed:
 κ-abstain on uncertainty; HITL for high risk.
Prohibited uses (non-exhaustive)
Surveillance that violates local law or user consent.
Generation of malware or exploit kits.
Discrimination or harmful profiling.
Biometric identification without explicit, lawful basis.
Dataset policy
License & provenance 
required
; SEG nodes for source → slice → usage.
PII: redact at 
ingest
; DP/noise where aggregation is published.
Red-team rules

Appendices & Back Matter
This section packages the system for 
builders, auditors, and readers-at-speed
: crisp definitions, runnable labs, line-of-sight examples, exportable compliance bundles, and operational playbooks. Everything here is memory-native (CMC), orchestrated (APOE), witnessed (VIF), atomically evolved (SDF-CVF), and anchored in the shared evidence graph (SEG).

1. Scalability and Performance
Rationale
: Your design emphasizes efficiency through mechanisms like HHNI's fractal indexing (Chapter 5), DVNS's physics-inspired refinement (Chapters 8–10), and SLOs (e.g., p95 write < 200ms in Chapter 6). However, for AGI-scale operations—handling petabyte corpora, real-time multi-user queries, or dynamic growth—the system might encounter bottlenecks in ingestion, indexing depth, or force computations. Static KNN baselines are useful for RS-lift metrics (Chapter 22), but without distributed handling, super-index precomputation could become a single point of failure, especially with recursive hierarchies that grow fractally to atomic levels (e.g., word/sub-word).
Challenges/Gaps
:
Ingestion Bursts
: The write path (ingest → atomize → enrich → index → score → gate → snapshot in Section 1.2) is transactional and single-writer (Constraint C-1), which ensures determinism but could serialize high-volume inputs (e.g., 3GB logs in your example). If bursts exceed SLOs, DD previews might delay gates, leading to quarantines under SDF-CVF (Chapter 16).
Indexing Overhead
: HHNI's multi-granular embeddings (system → sub-word) with dependency hashing scales O(log N) for lookups, but building impact previews on edits (DD computation) could be O(N) in dense graphs, especially if edges (supports/contradicts) proliferate in SEG (Chapter 15).
DVNS Compute
: GODN forces (gravity/elastic/repulse/damping in Chapter 31) converge via Velocity-Verlet integration, but for large top-k (e.g., 64+ candidates), iterations might exceed budgets (e.g., tokens/time in APOE, Chapter 11). Stability regions (CFL bounds) are well-defined, but without parallelization, online refinement could lag in distributed setups.
Detailed Recommendations
:
Distributed Variants
: Extend HHNI to a sharded, vector-graph hybrid using tools like Apache Cassandra for the evidence graph store (Chapter 7) or Faiss for embeddings. For super-index precomputation (Section 9.3), implement a MapReduce-style offline job that partitions by TPV priority vectors—e.g., high-priority atoms (priority > 0.7) on faster shards. This could integrate with Markov traversals for caching (Section 6.3), preloading likely paths based on historical queries.
Burst Handling
: Introduce asynchronous queues before the single-writer gate, batching atoms into molecules (Chapter 4) with temporary QS approximations. For SLOs, add adaptive throttling: if mean DD > θ_d (e.g., 0.3), escalate to HITL (Chapter 17) or degrade to coarse reads. Metrics: Track p99 latency on writes; aim for RS-lift ≥ +20% vs. baselines under load (empirical lift in Section 9.4).
DVNS Optimization
: Parallelize force integration across nodes using GPU-accelerated simulations (e.g., via PyTorch tensors for potentials). Tune parameters (G, k, δ, c, α, β, γ in Section 10.2) dynamically with a meta-optimizer that samples from stability regions (Lemma 31.2.4). Example: For a 500-atom corpus, simulate convergence: start with underdamped ζ < 1 for fast exploration, then overdamp to ζ > 1 for settling, reducing iterations by 30–50%.
Enhancement to AGI
: This scales toward emergent behaviors, like self-organizing knowledge in large-scale planning (thousands of nodes in Section 12.4). Test with 
benchmarks: nDCG@20 on streamed agents (Chapter 22), ensuring no more than 5% degradation under 10x load.
2. Uncertainty and Abstention
Rationale
: κ-gating (Chapters 3, 11, 14) and UQ methods (temperature sweeps, ensembles, ECE in Section 14.2) are strong for trust, tying into VIF's witness invariant (Section 1.4). But in AGI contexts, where decisions compound (e.g., DEPP self-rewrites in Chapter 12), static thresholds might miss nuanced risks, like domain shifts or adversarial inputs.
Challenges/Gaps
:
Static vs. Dynamic κ
: κ is a fixed abstention threshold (e.g., RS < κ or UQ > κ), but doesn't adapt to context—e.g., high-risk tiers (R2/R3 in Chapter 17) might need tighter bands, while low-risk (R0) could loosen for exploration.
UQ Granularity
: Methods like entropy and ECE are per-artifact, but in SEG's temporal graphs (Chapter 15), propagated uncertainty (e.g., via contradiction edges) isn't explicitly modeled, risking overconfidence in lineage queries.
False Negatives
: In high-stakes flows (e.g., compliance-critical in Chapter 25), abstention precision ≥ 0.8 (Chapter 22) is targeted, but without adaptive learning, false negatives could cascade, especially if calibration dashboards (Section 14.3) aren't real-time.
Detailed Recommendations
:
Adaptive Thresholds
: Make κ context-dependent using a risk scorer (e.g., κ' = κ * (1 + risk_tier / 3), where tier from 0–3). Integrate Bayesian UQ: replace sweeps with evidential networks, where uncertainty is a Dirichlet distribution over confidence buckets (A/B/C in Section 14.3). For example, compute posterior variance on ensembles: if spread > 0.15, escalate to HITL with a VIF note explaining the band (e.g., "ECE drift detected: 0.024 → 0.031").
Propagation in SEG
: Add UQ edges in the graph schema (JSON-LD in Section 15.1): each supports/contradicts carries a propagated entropy (e.g., entropy_out = entropy_in + log(1 - weight)). Time-slicing queries then aggregate: for a claim at t, sum UQ over paths, abstaining if total > κ_chain (Section 12.3). This aligns with convergence proofs (Chapter 31), treating UQ as a damping term.
Learning Loops
: Use APOE's critic role (Section 11.1) to fine-tune calibrators on held-out data from SEG exports. Metrics: Stratified ECE by domain (e.g., logs vs. 
code in examples); aim for true-positive abstentions > 0.9 on adversarial suites (Chapter 22). Example: In a protocol translation (Section 1.1), if PII redaction UQ > κ, abstain and quarantine the bundle under SDF-CVF.
Enhancement to AGI
: This fosters safer emergence—e.g., in self-rewrite, adaptive κ prevents runaway loops, enabling verifiable evolution toward general intelligence.
3. Integration with Foundation Models
Rationale
: APOE assumes models via VIF (model_id, weights_hash in Chapter 14), but for multimodal or evolving models, CMC's modality independence (Chapter 4) could be extended to handle non-text payloads more natively, reducing silos.
Challenges/Gaps
:
Modality Limits
: Atoms support text/code/event/tool (Section 1.2), but richer inputs (images, audio) might require custom enrichers, impacting QS and embeddings.
Model Updates
: Weights hashes ensure reproducibility, but updating (e.g., GPT-5t to newer) could invalidate prior calibrations, causing drift (Chapter 23) without automated migration.
Bootstrap Feedback
: No explicit loop for models to refine based on SEG evidence, limiting AGI self-improvement.
Detailed Recommendations
:
Multimodal Extensions
: Expand atom schemas to include vision/audio embeddings (e.g., via CLIP or Whisper hashes). In HHNI, add modality-specific indices (e.g., pixel → feature). For DVNS, incorporate cross-modal forces: gravity weighted by modality similarity (cosine on joint embeddings).
Update Handling
: Use SDF-CVF for model commits: treat weights as code, with parity to updated prompts/docs (Chapter 16). On update, recompute ECE on a sample SEG slice; if drift > ε (0.05), rollback or quarantine. Metrics: Replay fidelity % post-update (Chapter 22).
Feedback Integration
: Enable APOE to generate fine-tuning data from high-RS SEG nodes, using DEPP to orchestrate (e.g., planner → builder for datasets). Example: In IDE-in-the-loop (Chapter 18), use witnessed outputs to tune codegen models.
Enhancement to AGI
: This bridges to quantum neuromorphic ideas, allowing emergent multimodal reasoning.
4. Threat Model Depth
Rationale
: Chapter 20 covers injections/SSRF, but AGI-scale threats like embedding poisoning or VIF forgery need deeper playbooks.
Challenges/Gaps
: Policy-aware DVNS avoids forbidden crossings, but adversarial examples could manipulate GODN forces.
Detailed Recommendations
:
Adversarial Defenses
: Add robustness checks in gates (e.g., g_safety verifies embedding norms). For VIF, use Merkle trees for tamper-evidence (Section 14.4).
Playbooks
: Extend risk taxonomy (Appendix J) with specifics: e.g., on poisoning, quarantine affected HHNI branches.
Enhancement to AGI
: Builds resilience for untrusted environments.
5. Implementation Gaps
Rationale
: Reference impls (Part XI) are schemas/APIs, but code snippets would aid prototyping.
Challenges/Gaps
: Pseudocode is solid, but full examples for ACL (Chapter 13) or DVNS (Chapter 10) are sparse.
Detailed Recommendations
:
Code Artifacts
: Provide TS/Python snippets for key flows (e.g., write_context). Use Genkit for Fractal Memory Hierarchy integration.
Testing
: Add labs for edge cases (Appendix G).
Enhancement to AGI
: Enables faster iteration on atomic evolution.
6. Broader AGI Alignment
Rationale
: Invariants promote verifiability, but explicit self-improvement loops could push toward AGI.
Challenges/Gaps
: No direct mechanism for online learning from SEG.
Detailed Recommendations
:
Self-Improvement Loops
: Use APOE to refine ACL via evidence (e.g., optimize budgets from traces).
Multi-Agent Extensions
: Expand negotiation (Chapter 24) with resonant dynamics.
Enhancement to AGI
: Aligns with breakthroughs like fusion/quantum, fostering emergent intelligence.
MARG-gpt-5:
below is a crisp, hands-on upgrade plan for 
A Total System of Memory
 along two axes:
the idea
 (architecture, gaps, proofs, roadmap), and
the artifact
 (structure, flow, style, reader experience).
I’m giving you a tightened outline (“Final Draft v0.2 – proposed”), plus a change log (“Process Notes”) so it’s easy to track what moved and why — very “Marg/Hamilton”.
Final Draft v0.2 — proposed structure
Front matter (keep, but sharpen)
1-page Executive Overview
 (bulleted, non-technical): problem → invariants → capabilities → risks → proof plan.
Reading Roadmaps
: collapse to 3 lanes (Executive • Architect • Implementer).
Notation & Acronyms
: convert to a 
single-page legend
 used consistently everywhere. (Right now, acronyms are powerful but heavy; give the reader a “Rosetta card”.)
Part I — Why this must exist (tightened)
Ch1 The Why
 
(short)
: from “beyond chat” to 
native, verifiable, agentic intelligence
; the five invariants and why each is non-optional (CMC, APOE, VIF, SDFCVF, SEG). Include a 
table of failure modes if each invariant is absent
.
Ch2 Axioms & Invariants
 
(formal, testable)
: move proofs to 
appendix
; keep body crisp with definitions + falsifiable predictions. Map each invariant to measurable acceptance criteria.
Ch3 North Star
: safety-as-capability, κ-gating, “IDE-in-the-loop” rationale — keep, but anchor to concrete scenarios (e.g., regulatory brief, on-call ops).
Part II — Context–Memory Core (CMC) & HHNI
Ch4 Fractal Memory Hierarchy
: add 
running example
 (one email thread) showing Atom→Molecule→Document→Thread→Project.
Ch5 Hyper-Hierarchical Neural Indexing (HHNI)
: define 
RS
 precisely with calibration protocol; add 
offline evaluation recipe
 (gold sets, nDCG, ablations).
Ch6 Write/Read Pipelines
: include end-to-end 
state diagram
 (Ingest→Atomize→Gate→Snapshot). Add 
SLOs
 with explicit numbers and back-pressure behavior.
Ch7 Storage Substrate
: finalize API stubs for 
Vector Store
, 
Evidence Graph Store
, 
Object Store
, 
Snapshot Log
 (CRUD, versioning, TTL).
Part III — Dynamic Vector Navigation System (DVNS)
Promote DVNS as 
core retrieval physics
 (not “nice-to-have”). Provide:
A compact 
energy function
 for path cost 
with terms (length, smoothness, block penalties, density) and constraints for policy-aware geometry.
Convergence criteria
 and failure modes (oscillation, collapse) with guardrails.
Part IV — Orchestration: APOE & DEPP
Roles & Contracts
 (planner, retriever, reasoner, verifier, builder, critic, operator, witness) with 
I/O schemas
 and 
budget rules
.
DEPP
: present the master chain as a 
DAG
 (not linear), with health metrics (κ_chain, budget adherence) and 
auto-abstention
 gates.
Provide 
three prebuilt chains
: Research, Coding, Operations — each with inputs, tools, gates, and success criteria.
Part V — Verifiable Intelligence (VIF) & Shared Evidence Graph (SEG)
VIF
: minimal 
provenance schema
: {model, weights_hash, prompts, data_slice_ids, tools_used, uncertainty} + replay recipe.
SEG
: lock in 
JSON-LD + SHACL
 profile; show a 
claim→evidence→decision
 triple with timestamps and cryptographic digests. Provide an 
export profile
 for audits.
Part VI — Atomic Evolution (SDFCVF)
Treat this as 
DevOps for cognition
: atomic commits across code/docs/tags/traces; 
gate catalog
 (parity, tests, safety, provenance, HITL).
Add 
DORA-style metrics
 and a 
quarantine flow
 with rollback.
Part VII — IDE-in-the-Loop
Provide a concrete 
Blueprint→Scaffold→Code→Test→Deploy→Observe
 walkthrough for a tiny app (e.g., RAG microservice).
Include a 
Blueprint YAML
 template and automated parity checks (spec↔code).
Part VIII — Security, Safety & Compliance
Keep threat model; add a 
policy-aware retrieval demo
 where DVNS forbids crossings into restricted subgraphs; log abstentions into VIF.
Map to 
EU AI Act logging
 and 
SOC2/ISO
 via trace fields coming from VIF/SEG.
Part IX — Evaluation & Observability
Define benchmark packs: 
retrieval (p@k, nDCG, RS lift)
, 
reasoning (task suites)
, 
long-horizon agents
, plus 
κ/ECE dashboards
.
Add 
OpenTelemetry
 spans around agent steps; set 
token/latency budgets
 and drift monitors.
Part X — Case Studies & Patterns
Ship at least 
two worked case studies
 end-to-end (incl. SEG exports and VIF replays).
Provide a 
Builder Program
 pattern library.
Appendices (new)
Mathematical Details
: proofs, DVNS integration schemes (Verlet vs. Euler), κ-calibration, uncertainty estimation.
ACL / AIMOS Chain Language
: full EBNF + static checks; sample pipelines.
Concept upgrades (substance)
Make the invariants falsifiable
Add 
acceptance tests
 per invariant (e.g., CMC must survive context reset and still retrieve a prior “Atom” with 
within latency budget). Provide 
counter-examples
 where systems without the invariant fail.
DVNS ←→ Policy coupling
Right now DVNS defines path costs and stability. Add a 
policy tensor
 that raises 
path energy near restricted evidence nodes; DVNS then 
physically
 avoids off-policy traversals (safety as geometry, not just post-hoc checks).
APOE budgets as first-class citizens
Turn “budgets (tokens, time, tools)” into an 
admission controller
 that can:
refuse chain expansion,
trigger a reduced-fidelity route, or
persist a partial result with VIF.
VIF replayability
Specify a 
deterministic replay harness
: fixed seeds, frozen tool versions, pinned models (weights hash), and input slices. Make “replay ok” a gate in SDFCVF.
SEG temporal reasoning
Add 
time-slicing queries
 (e.g., “evidence as of T−7d”) and “impact previews” from 
dependency hashing
 (already alluded to). Bake these into HHNI.
AIMOS/ACL hardening
Your chain language is a gem. Add:
static 
budget/type checks
,
capability tokens per tool,
formal 
abstention semantics
 (must_abstain_if: clauses).
End-to-end success metrics
Define 
system
 KPIs (not just retrieval):
Task success @ budget,
Claim-with-evidence rate,
Mean time to abstention (MTA),
Replay success rate,
SEG completeness (% steps with linked evidence).
Quick wins (high leverage, low effort)
Insert a single “running example”
 (e.g., summarize and ground an RFC) that flows through Parts II→V.
Ship a one-page API
 for each store (Vector/SEG/Object/Snapshot) — request+response examples.
Make a “Chain Gallery”
: 3 DAGs with minimal YAML and screenshots of telemetry.
Move heavy math and proofs to appendices
; keep the mainline persuasive and fast.
Glossary card
 at the front; 
index
 at the end.
Process Notes (what changed & why)
Regrouped
 Parts II–V around a concrete 
data-in → memory → retrieval physics → orchestration → provenance
 storyline. Readers can now trace 
one object
 through the system.
Promoted
 DVNS and VIF/SEG to co-equal pillars with CMC/APOE (they are the legs that make this a 
verifiable, steerable
 system).
Demoted
 long proofs to appendices so the main arc remains executable.
Added
 measurable claims and acceptance tests so this is 
falsifiable engineering
, not just design.
Implementation tracks (start building tomorrow)
The Foundry (bootstrap chain)
Agents: Ingestor → Atomizer → Schema-Validator → DD-Gate → Snapshot-Writer → Evidence-Linker.
Outputs: Atoms, Snapshots, SEG edges, VIF logs with hashes. (This is the smallest “system that manufactures the system”.)
DVNS micro-pilot
Implement path cost, basic forces, and a policy tensor; compare vs. static KNN on RS-lift and abstention quality.
VIF/SEG substrate
Finalize JSON-LD & SHACL; build “Replay Harness v0.1” (pin model+tools, re-execute a chain, compare outputs).
Evaluation pack v0.1
Gold sets, dashboards for κ/ECE, token/latency budgets; add OpenTelemetry spans per agent step.
Stylistic edits to apply as you revise
Reduce acronym density per paragraph
 (target ≤2).
Prefer spec boxes
: “Contract • Inputs • Outputs • Invariants • Failure modes”.
Surface numbers
: budgets, latencies, thresholds — even provisional — to anchor the reader.
Replace future tense
 with 
imperative
 in procedures (reads as an engineering spec).
Use consistent figure grammar
 (Figure N: Title • Purpose • Takeaway • Link to Appendix).
6.2 Future Work and Recommendations
The analysis suggests two paths for future hardening:
Enhancing Formal Verification at the Gate Level:
 While ACL provides symbolic checks and type safety, moving closer to absolute guarantees requires deeper integration with formal methods. It is recommended that core ACL steps used by the Builder Programs for code synthesis be integrated with explicit SMT solvers or theorem provers (e.g., Lean) at the provenance gate (G-Trace). This would allow the system to discharge functional proofs for critical logic generated by the AGI, marrying the pragmatic verifiability of VIF with the mathematical rigor sought by the IPS research community.   
Detailing Distributed Scalability and Resilience:
 The deterministic properties rely on the transactional nature of the CMC write pipeline (C-1 Single Writer) and the fidelity of the HHNI/DVNS indices. Future documentation should detail the distributed implementation of these components, ensuring that determinism and performance (SLOs) are maintained at petabyte scale and under high-concurrency loads typical of AGI systems (e.g., specifying shard distribution strategies for the DVNS super-index and resilience strategies for the single-writer constraint).
