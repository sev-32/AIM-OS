# PLAN Chunk 2

1. **Core Goal Definition Layer:** Encode seed goals as SEG meta-nodes capturing objectives, constraints, and KPIs.
2. **Idea Decomposition Engine:** Recursively break goals into subsystems and idea fragments tagged as hypotheses, design patterns, or implementation steps.
3. **Prioritization & Conflict Resolution:** Use QS, DD, and redundancy heuristics to rank ideas, flag contradictions, and prompt resolution strategies.
4. **Hierarchical Tagging & Indexing:** Organize ideas across abstract, functional, and operational layers with dynamic tags for relevance, maturity, and provenance.
5. **Summary-to-Detail Navigation:** Provide multi-resolution summaries with metrics (completeness, confidence, risk) to support drill-down and zoom-out workflows.
6. **Executable Blueprint Generation:** Transform curated idea graphs into specs, code scaffolds, or workflow descriptions, feeding execution feedback back into the idea graph.
7. **Operationalization:** Extend CMC metadata schemas, deploy refinement agents, build cognitive mapping interfaces, and embed self-optimization loops that propose expansions and flag gaps.

Significance: adds the creative cognition layer that turns retained knowledge into prioritized, executable system designs.

### External Contributor Ideas (GPT-5 Sev)
- **Keep/Amplify:** Maintain the current spine (five invariants), repo-first knowledge organization, validation tracks, and collaboration protocol.
- **Memory Spine Integration:** Ensure every analysis artifact is ingested as atoms → snapshots → SEG nodes; avoid standalone markdown outside CMC.
- **Plans-as-Code:** Store executable ACL plans in `plans/`; run with the APOE runner to emit VIF and SEG artifacts.
- **Declared KPIs and Gates:** Each themed bundle should define experiments and acceptance metrics enforced via CI.
- **Operator UX Hooks:** Provide stubs for lineage view, replay controls, and confidence chips in the operator console.
- **Recommended Monorepo Layout:** `analysis/`, `packages/` (cmc-service, seg-service, vif-service, apoe-runner, sdcvf-gatekeeper, operator-console), `plans/`, `schemas/`, `blueprints/`, `tools/otel/`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, top-level `README.md`.
- **Seed Content:** Populate `analysis/README.md`, `analysis/themes/observability.md`, ACL sample plans (`research_note.acl`, `compliance_redactor.acl`), and supporting scripts described below.
- **Automation Scripts:**
  - `scripts/ingest-analysis.ts` to ingest markdown into CMC and trigger snapshots.
  - `scripts/run-plan.ts` to execute an ACL recipe via the APOE runner.
  - `scripts/seed-seg.ts` to create demo SEG nodes and lineage.
- **Immediate Backlog:** HHNI read-path enhancements, κ-gating enforcement, VIF replay endpoint, SEG export packs, SDF-CVF parity blocking, operator console prototype, and multi-writer CMC RFC.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Successful ingestion returns snapshot ids, running `research_note.acl` emits a band A/B witness, lineage queries resolve to witness nodes, export packs validate and include replay instructions, and parity gates block low-score merges while logging autofix TODOs.

### Additional Detail (GPT-5 Sev — Idea Foundry Layer)
- **Purpose:** Formalize idea cultivation as a first-class subsystem atop AIMOS, linking seeds to executable blueprints under memory/evidence discipline.
- **Lifecycle:** Seed → Harvest concepts → Sculpt into index → Prioritize → Resolve conflicts → Ladder summaries → Emit blueprint → Evolve via parity gates.
- **Data Model Additions:** `IdeaSeed`, `Concept`, conflict `Relation`, `DesignDecision`, and `Blueprint` atoms/nodes living in CMC/SEG with VIF witnesses.
- **Priority Score:** `P = (Value·Leverage·Alignment) × (1 - Risk) × Effort^{-α}` with dependency boosts (default α = 1).
- **Abstraction Ladder:** maintain tagline, executive summary, design brief, spec, and source references with witnessed APOE steps.
- **Conflict Handling:** semantic clustering + LSH for duplicates; rule templates for contradictions; APOE merge steps issuing VIF-backed ADRs.
- **Executable Plan:** `plans/idea_foundry.acl` runs capture → harvest → cluster → dedupe/conflicts → ladder → prioritize → blueprint → witness.
- **New Package:** `packages/idea-foundry/` with `/seed`, `/grow`, `/blueprint/:id` endpoints; schemas for seeds and concepts; operator console “Idea” tab (index tree, priority table, conflict lens, ladder view).
- **Sprint Plan:**
  - *Sprint 1:* deliver endpoints, clustering/dedupe, priority scoring, laddered summaries, SEG-backed Master Index, operator tab.
  - *Sprint 2:* generate blueprint-driven APOE plan stubs, ADR workflow with witnesses, SDF-CVF parity integration, cut-line views (v0/v1/v2).
- **Integration Points:** seeds/concepts logged in CMC → SEG; APOE enforces κ-gating; VIF witnesses all summaries; SDF-CVF governs blueprint-to-code merges.

### External Contributor Ideas (Claude Sonnet 4)
See detailed analysis in `analysis/CLAUDE_IDEAS.md` — eight recursive enhancement concepts:
1. **Emergent Memory Crystallization (EMC):** Auto-crystallize frequently accessed, high-confidence memory patterns into optimized structures.
2. **Cognitive Resonance Networks (CRN):** Resonance-based memory organization with self-strengthening concept clusters.
3. **Temporal Memory Dynamics (TMD):** Dynamic temporal memory with gradients, prediction horizons, and causal flow modeling.
4. **Multi-Modal Memory Fusion (MMF):** Unified atoms for text/code/images/audio with cross-modal reasoning capabilities.
5. **Recursive Intelligence Amplification (RIA):** Self-improvement as memory-native process with cognitive rollback and meta-witnesses.
6. **Collaborative Intelligence Mesh (CIM):** True cognitive meshing between AI systems with distributed witnesses and mesh-native memory.
7. **Adaptive Interface Evolution (AIE):** Self-adapting UIs that evolve based on cognitive load while maintaining full auditability.
8. **Recursive Meta-Analysis (RMA):** Continuous meta-analysis of analysis processes with self-correcting cognitive loops.

### How to Use the Current Organization (for AI Collaborators)
- **Orientation Path:**
  1. Read `analysis/PLAN.md` → captures thesis, external proposals, and current roadmap.
  2. Consult tiered summaries (`analysis/summaries/overview.md`, `mid.md`, `deep/*.md`) for context-size-aware ingestion.
  3. Use `analysis/chunks/index.json` to fetch relevant slices of the plan; each entry lists headings, tags, and estimated tokens.
- **Source & Notes:**
  - `analysis/raw/*.txt` stores extracted source documents.
  - `analysis/supporting_docs_catalog.csv` + `supporting_docs_notes.md` summarize docs with invariant tags and open questions.
- **Themed Analysis:** `analysis/themes/*.md` synthesize insights for memory, orchestration, safety, governance, and observability, linking to sources and listing unresolved research items.
- **Workflow README:** `analysis/README.md` explains rituals (ingest → snapshot → SEG), conventions (tags, citations), and tooling.
- **Automation:** `scripts/build_chunks.py` regenerates summaries + chunk registry; `scripts/ingest-analysis.ts` ingests content into CMC; other scripts scaffold plan execution and SEG seeding.
- **Next Steps for New AI:**
  1. Contextualize `A Total System of Memory` via the master index & summaries.
