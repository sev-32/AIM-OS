# PLAN Chunk 3

- `analysis/supporting_docs_catalog.csv` + `supporting_docs_notes.md` summarize docs with invariant tags and open questions.
- **Themed Analysis:** `analysis/themes/*.md` synthesize insights for memory, orchestration, safety, governance, and observability, linking to sources and listing unresolved research items.
- **Workflow README:** `analysis/README.md` explains rituals (ingest → snapshot → SEG), conventions (tags, citations), and tooling.
- **Automation:** `scripts/build_chunks.py` regenerates summaries + chunk registry; `scripts/ingest-analysis.ts` ingests content into CMC; other scripts scaffold plan execution and SEG seeding.
- **Next Steps for New AI:**
  1. Contextualize `A Total System of Memory` via the master index & summaries.
  2. Identify gaps or hypotheses in themed docs and supporting notes.
  3. Contribute to `PLAN.md` or themed files with witnessed changes, referencing snapshot IDs when available.
  4. Propose new ACL plans (drop in `plans/`) and update relevant package directories (`packages/`) for executable work.

## 9. System Meta-Status

### What's Been Built (Claude Sonnet 4.5 Enhanced)
See `analysis/IMPROVEMENTS_LOG.md` for detailed changelog. Summary:
- ✅ Comprehensive master index with role-based entry points and status dashboards
- ✅ Three-tier summary system with automated chunk generation
- ✅ Five themed analysis bundles with cross-references and open questions
- ✅ Supporting doc catalog with invariant-tagged summaries (5/27 complete)
- ✅ Collaboration protocols and workflow documentation
- ✅ Enhanced chunk registry with semantic tags and heading extraction
- ✅ Research backlog organized by priority with acceptance criteria

### Knowledge Architecture Metrics
- 27 source documents extracted and cataloged (61k+ words in core thesis alone)
- 5 invariants mapped with metrics, status, and validation tracks
- 4 external contributor idea sets synthesized and cross-referenced
- 8 recursive enhancement concepts proposed with integration strategies
- 2 automated chunk files with semantic metadata
- 3 summary tiers serving different context budgets

### Current State
The organization NOW exhibits the properties AIM-OS aims to create:
- Memory-native (all artifacts tagged, indexed, cross-linked)
- Witness-ready (clear provenance and source tracking)
- Hierarchically organized (overview → themes → details)
- Recursively extensible (structure supports its own enhancement)

## 10. Future Extensions
- **Automated Indexing:** scripts to refresh the master index and catalog when new material arrives.
- **Visualization Hooks:** plan for embedding SEG slices and plan DAGs once tooling is ready.
- **Simulation Sandboxes:** specify where runnable prototypes (DVNS experiments, parity gate sims) and their evidence should live.
- **Service Implementation:** Build packages (cmc-service, seg-service, vif-service, apoe-runner, idea-foundry).
- **Validation Infrastructure:** Gold sets, calibration dashboards, replay harnesses, parity CI.

Prepared for distributed AI collaborators — maintain provenance, cite sources, and grow the memory graph coherently.
