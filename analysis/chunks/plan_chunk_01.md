# PLAN Chunk 1

# AIM-OS Master Plan

## 1. Purpose
- Establish a shared, auditable roadmap encapsulating the thesis, operating primitives, and expansion paths of `A Total System of Memory`.
- Provide a hand-off artifact for multi-agent collaboration so every contributor anchors work to invariants, roles, and evidence requirements.

## 2. Core Thesis (Machine Communication Stack)
- **CMC (Context Memory Core):** Atomize, index, snapshot, and graph every IO; enforce single-writer determinism and reversible memory.
- **APOE (Prompt Orchestration Engine):** Compile intent into typed, budgeted plans with explicit gates; orchestrate planners, retrievers, verifiers with abstention control.
- **VIF (Verifiable Intelligence Framework):** Boundary outputs emit replayable, signed evidence with uncertainty vectors and lineage metadata.
- **SDF-CVF (Atomic Evolution Framework):** Code, docs, tests, traces move together via enforced gates, quarantine loops, and auto-remediation.
- **SEG (Shared Evidence Graph):** Time-sliced, contradiction-aware provenance graph underpinning audit, replay, and policy traceability.

## 3. Knowledge Organization Framework
- **Raw Source Vault:** `analysis/raw/*.txt` mirrors every artifact (DOCX/PDF) for reproducible parsing.
- **Structural Map:** `analysis/core_map.md` lists canonical parts/chapters/appendices for navigation.
- **Master Index:** `analysis/MASTER_INDEX.md` anchors invariants, documents, and cross-links into themed bundles.
- **Supporting Catalog:** `analysis/supporting_docs_catalog.csv` plus `analysis/supporting_docs_notes.md` capture metadata and summaries.
- **Themed Bundles:** `analysis/themes/*.md` synthesize concepts, cite sources, and capture open questions.
- **Operations README:** `analysis/README.md` will codify workflows, naming conventions, and extension guidelines.

## 4. Expansion & Enhancement Strategy
1. **Deep Summaries:** For each supporting doc, extract thesis, align to invariants, tag with KPIs, and log evidence expectations in `supporting_docs_notes.md`.
2. **Concept Mesh:** Populate themed bundles with concept summaries, interaction narratives (e.g., DVNS <-> CMC), and research TODOs.
3. **Workflow Recipes:** Document repeatable chains (protocol translation, IDE-in-loop builds) with inputs, budgets, gates, and expected VIF/SEG outputs.
4. **Validation Tracks:** Define experiments or audits per invariant (RS lift benchmarks, kappa calibration suites, SDF-CVF parity drills) inside `analysis/themes/observability.md`.
5. **Governance Layer:** Capture risk tiers, HITL rotations, and community rituals in `analysis/themes/governance.md`, linking to policies and appendices.
6. **Roadmap Integration:** Map AGI-aligned growth paths (self-improvement loops, multimodal expansion, distributed scaling) to milestones referencing supporting docs.

## 5. Collaboration Protocol (Multi-Agent Hand-off)
- **Entry Checklist:** read the master index, then the relevant themed file before contributing; preserve tone and structure.
- **Contribution Workflow:** note rationale + source tie-ins, register new tasks in TODO blocks with owner/status, and log major structural updates.
- **Evidence Discipline:** link every recommendation to source text and anticipated witness artifacts (VIF envelope fields, SEG edges, KPIs).

## 6. Immediate Next Actions
1. Populate themed bundles (memory, orchestration, safety, governance, observability) with synthesized insights and pointers.
2. Enrich supporting notes: write multi-paragraph summaries per doc with invariant tags like `[CMC]`, `[APOE]`.
3. Flesh out `analysis/README.md` with workflow rituals, file naming standards, and review cadence.
4. Surface open questions (e.g., DVNS stability proofs, adaptive kappa research) into a shared R&D backlog within the master index or themed docs.

## 7. External Contributor Ideas (Perplexity AI)
- **Knowledge Extraction Pipeline:** Use GPT-5 Codex and Cursor IDE to extract, tag, and index concepts, principles, and procedures into structured JSON-LD or knowledge-graph forms.
- **Self-Referential Prompt Chains:** Implement orchestration chains that mutate prior knowledge artifacts to test hypothesis generation, revision, and verification loops.
- **Meta-Knowledge Manager:** Build modules for versioning, branching, merging, and rollback of knowledge artifactsâ€”adapting software-style VCS discipline to knowledge development.
- **Multi-Agent System Coordination:** Deploy specialized agents (analysis, summarization, novelty detection, coherence checks, traceability audits) collaborating asynchronously to accelerate refinement.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Guidance:** Design interfaces exposing the evolving mental map, enabling targeted interventions, feedback loops, and collaborative problem solving.
- **Cross-Model Experimentation:** Parallelize implementations across GPT-5 Codex, GPT-4 Turbo, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5, and other LLMs to compare strengths and blend insights.

### Additional Detail (Perplexity AI, Iteration 2)
1. **Self-Referential Knowledge Extraction:** Parse the corpus into structured ontologies/JSON-LD with semantic tags (CMC, APOE, VIF) to form a living cognitive substrate.
2. **Recursive Prompting & Meta-Prompt Optimization:** Build multi-stage prompt chains that refine outputs using the hierarchical memory schema; let APOE agents learn adaptive meta-prompts.
3. **Modular Knowledge Artifacts with Version Control:** Implement git-like commits, branching, and automated validation for knowledge nodes, prompt chains, and verification traces.
4. **Multi-Agent Creative Synthesis:** Coordinate agents for synthesis, coherence checks, redundancy pruning, and trace auditing; enable feedback loops into AIMOS memory.
5. **Interactive AI-Human Interfaces:** Visualize multi-scale concept maps, orchestration workflows, and audit traces while allowing human interventions and seeding of new questions.
6. **Cross-Model Experimentation:** Run comparative workflows across GPT-5 Codex, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5, and open models to build a multi-model ontology and best-practice library.

Visionary outcome: a meta-evolving cognition kernel where AIMOS/APOE continually refines itself through recursive symbolic assembly and human-AI synergy.

### Additional Detail (Perplexity AI, Iteration 3)
1. **Core Goal Definition Layer:** Encode seed goals as SEG meta-nodes capturing objectives, constraints, and KPIs.
2. **Idea Decomposition Engine:** Recursively break goals into subsystems and idea fragments tagged as hypotheses, design patterns, or implementation steps.
3. **Prioritization & Conflict Resolution:** Use QS, DD, and redundancy heuristics to rank ideas, flag contradictions, and prompt resolution strategies.
4. **Hierarchical Tagging & Indexing:** Organize ideas across abstract, functional, and operational layers with dynamic tags for relevance, maturity, and provenance.
5. **Summary-to-Detail Navigation:** Provide multi-resolution summaries with metrics (completeness, confidence, risk) to support drill-down and zoom-out workflows.
6. **Executable Blueprint Generation:** Transform curated idea graphs into specs, code scaffolds, or workflow descriptions, feeding execution feedback back into the idea graph.
