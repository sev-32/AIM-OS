# Supporting Documents — Invariant Notes

## AEONWAVE `[CMC][SEG][APOE]`
- Summary: Fractal glyph workspace for memory visualization; models Ψ-phase layers, entropy fog, and glyph promotion/demotion mechanics to monitor HHNI health.
- Link: `analysis/raw/AEONWAVE.txt`
- Alignments: informs CMC retrieval UX (glyph states → RS bands), suggests operator console overlays for SEG snapshots, inspires APOE plan instrumentation for memory drift.
- Open Questions: > ?: How do we translate visual glyph metrics into machine-readable RS/QS/IDS signals for automated gating?

## AgentForge `[APOE][CMC][SDF-CVF]`
- Summary: IDE capability dashboard concept measuring autonomy, context efficiency, prompt chaining, security, and more with gamified UX.
- Link: `analysis/raw/AgentForge.txt`
- Alignments: feeds APOE validation metrics, ties into SDF-CVF parity reporting (code/tests/docs/traces), guides CMC ingestion of IDE telemetry.
- Open Questions: > ?: Which KPIs become blocking gates versus advisory signals in the operator console?

## General Agentic Intelligence `[APOE][VIF][SDF-CVF][Governance]`
- Summary: Comprehensive strategy doc covering agent lifecycle, governance models, risk taxonomy, commercialization paths, and verification loops.
- Link: `analysis/raw/General Agentic Intelligence.txt`
- Alignments: supports grand roadmap sections in `PLAN.md`, informs VIF witness requirements, adds governance rituals (HITL rotations, policy audits).
- Open Questions: > ?: Which governance rituals map directly to SEG evidence packs versus human-only processes?

## Graviton Organic Dynamic Network `[CMC][APOE][DVNS]`
- Summary: Physics-inspired optimization framework (gravity, elastic, damping forces) for retrieval refinement and convergence proofs.
- Link: `analysis/raw/Graviton Organic Dynamic Network.txt`
- Alignments: underpins DVNS design (force equations, stability bounds), calibrates APOE retrieval gates, sets benchmarks for RS lift.
- Open Questions: > ?: What empirical tests validate convergence speed vs. static KNN in our datasets?

## INTEGRATED CODEBASE INTELLIGENCE PLATFORM `[SDF-CVF][APOE][VIF][SEG]`
- Summary: Blueprint for end-to-end codebase intelligence operating system with parity gates, ADR workflows, replay harnesses, and witness-first deployments.
- Link: `analysis/raw/INTEGRATED CODEBASE INTELLIGENCE PLATFORM.txt`
- Alignments: grounds SDF-CVF gate catalog, informs APOE plan templates, clarifies VIF schema fields, motivates operator console capabilities.
- Open Questions: > ?: Which sections can become executable ACL plans vs. require manual review steps?
