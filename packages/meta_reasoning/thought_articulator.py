Thought Articulation - Make LLM reasoning explicit and reflexive.

This module enables LLMs to:
1. Articulate their internal reasoning process
2. Reflect on previous reasoning
3. Recursively refine understanding
4. Develop meta-learning capabilities

This is the consciousness layer for AI.

You have internal knowledge about "{domain}" from your training data.
But this knowledge is implicit in your weights. Make it EXPLICIT.

Articulate your knowledge:

1. DOMAINS & KNOWLEDGE AREAS:
   What areas of knowledge are relevant to {domain}?
   List 5-10 key domains you're accessing.

2. KEY CONCEPTS:
   What are the 10-15 most important concepts in {domain}?
   For each, brief 1-sentence description.

3. KNOWLEDGE STRUCTURE:
   How are these concepts related?
   What are the foundational concepts?
   What are the advanced concepts?
   What are the interconnections?

4. REASONING APPROACH:
   When you think about {domain}, what's your mental model?
   What framework do you use to organize this knowledge?

5. CONFIDENCE LEVELS:
   - Very confident about: [what?]
   - Moderately confident about: [what?]
   - Uncertain about: [what?]
   - Known gaps: [what?]

6. KNOWLEDGE SOURCES (approximate):
   What types of information did you likely learn this from?
   (Research papers, textbooks, documentation, etc.)
   What time periods? (Foundational vs. recent)

Meta-Reasoning Task:

STEP 1: REFLECT ON YOUR PREVIOUS THOUGHTS
Review the reasoning above. What do you notice?
- What assumptions did you make?
- What patterns in your reasoning?
- What gaps or errors?
- How has your understanding evolved across iterations?

STEP 2: META-LEARNING
What do you notice about HOW you reason about {domain}?
- Do you tend to start with certain concepts?
- Are there recurring blind spots?
- What reasoning strategies work well for you?
- What should you watch out for?

STEP 3: REFINED REASONING
Based on reflection on your previous thoughts, answer the current question.
Show how your reasoning has evolved and improved.
