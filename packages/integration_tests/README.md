## 🎯 **What's Tested**

### **Data Flow:**
✅ HHNI retrieval results → APOE workflows  
✅ APOE operations → VIF witnesses  
✅ VIF witnesses → SDF-CVF traces  
✅ SDF-CVF parity → Quality feedback  

### **Quality Mechanisms:**
✅ Low HHNI relevance → Low VIF confidence → Failed APOE gates  
✅ High confidence operations → High parity scores  
✅ VIF witnesses enable meta-learning  
✅ SDF-CVF detects incomplete quartets  

### **Integration Patterns:**
✅ Memory-aware orchestration (APOE + HHNI)  
✅ Provenance-tracked retrieval (HHNI + VIF)  
✅ Quality-assured development (VIF + SDF-CVF)  
✅ Complete verifiable workflows (all systems)

## 📚 **Test Philosophy**

**Integration tests validate:**
1. **Interfaces work** - Systems communicate correctly
2. **Data flows** - Information passes between systems
3. **Patterns work** - Integration patterns are sound
4. **Quality emerges** - Systems enhance each other

**Integration tests do NOT:**
- Replace unit tests (those test individual components)
- Test full implementation (these test patterns and interfaces)
- Require all systems fully implemented (work with mocks)

**Approach:**
- Test the **integration pattern**, not the implementation
- Use **realistic scenarios** that show value
- Enable **meta-learning** through historical analysis
- Validate **quality mechanisms** work end-to-end

## 🌟 **Key Integration Insights**

### **1. Confidence Propagation**
HHNI relevance scores naturally become VIF confidence scores, which inform APOE quality gates, which affect SDF-CVF parity. This creates a **quality feedback loop**.

### **2. Provenance Chains**
VIF witnesses at every step create complete **audit trails** from initial retrieval through final artifacts.

### **3. Quality Prediction**
Historical VIF confidence scores predict future SDF-CVF parity scores, enabling **proactive quality management**.

### **4. Failure Detection**
Low quality at any stage (HHNI, APOE, VIF) is detected by subsequent stages, creating **robust quality assurance**.

### **5. Meta-Learning**
Integration patterns enable **cross-system optimization** through analysis of historical performance.
