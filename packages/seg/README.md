**Status:** 100% Complete (Production-Ready)  
**Tests:** 63 passing (100%)  
**Version:** 1.0

## Overview

SEG (Shared Evidence Graph) is a bitemporal knowledge graph for tracking entities, relations, and evidence with full time-travel capabilities and automatic contradiction detection.

**Key Features:**
- âœ… Bitemporal tracking (transaction time + valid time)
- âœ… Time-travel queries (query graph at any point in time)
- âœ… Provenance tracing (track entity lineage)
- âœ… Contradiction detection (find conflicting claims)
- âœ… NetworkX backend (fast, in-memory)
- âœ… CMC integration (atoms â†’ graph)
- âœ… VIF integration (provenance tracking)

---

## Quick Start

```python
from seg import SEGraph, Entity, Relation, RelationType, Evidence

# Create graph
graph = SEGraph()

# Add entities
e1 = Entity(
    type="concept",
    name="Machine Learning",
    attributes={"field": "ai"}
)
e2 = Entity(
    type="concept",
    name="Deep Learning",
    attributes={"field": "ai", "subset_of": "ml"}
)

graph.add_entity(e1)
graph.add_entity(e2)

# Add relation
relation = Relation(
    source_id=e1.id,
    target_id=e2.id,
    relation_type=RelationType.RELATES_TO,
    confidence=0.95
)
graph.add_relation(relation)

# Add evidence
evidence = Evidence(
    content="Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning",
    source="https://example.com/ml-tutorial",
    confidence=0.90
)
graph.add_evidence(evidence)

# Query the graph
entities = graph.list_entities(entity_type="concept")
print(f"Found {len(entities)} concepts")

# Time-travel query
from datetime import datetime, timezone
now = datetime.now(timezone.utc)
time_slice = graph.query_at(now)
print(f"Graph has {time_slice.entity_count} entities at this time")
```

---

## Core Concepts

### **Entities**

Entities represent things, concepts, or facts in the knowledge graph:

```python
entity = Entity(
    type="person",
    name="Alan Turing",
    attributes={
        "born": "1912",
        "field": "computer_science"
    },
    confidence=1.0
)
```

### **Relations**

Relations connect entities with typed relationships:

```python
relation = Relation(
    source_id="entity_1",
    target_id="entity_2",
    relation_type=RelationType.SUPPORTS,  # or CONTRADICTS, REFERENCES, etc.
    evidence_ids=["evidence_1", "evidence_2"],
    confidence=0.85
)
```

**Relation Types:**
- `SUPPORTS` - Entity 1 supports/confirms Entity 2
- `CONTRADICTS` - Entity 1 contradicts Entity 2
- `REFERENCES` - Entity 1 references Entity 2
- `DERIVES_FROM` - Entity 1 derives from Entity 2
- `RELATES_TO` - General relationship

### **Evidence**

Evidence supports claims and relations:

```python
evidence = Evidence(
    content="Research shows 95% accuracy",
    source="https://arxiv.org/abs/2023.12345",
    evidence_type="academic_paper",
    confidence=0.90,
    reliability=0.95,
    atom_id="atom_123"  # Link to CMC atom
)
```

---

## Bitemporal Tracking

SEG tracks two time dimensions for every entity and relation:

**Transaction Time (tt_start, tt_end):**
- When was this recorded in the system?
- Enables time-travel to see what we knew at any point

**Valid Time (vt_start, vt_end):**
- When was this true in the real world?
- Enables historical accuracy

```python
# Entity has both time dimensions
entity = Entity(
    type="event",
    name="Apollo 11 Landing",
    vt_start=datetime(1969, 7, 20),  # When it happened
    tt_start=datetime.now()            # When we recorded it
)
```

---

## Time-Travel Queries

### **Query at Specific Time**

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone

# See graph as it was yesterday
yesterday = datetime.now(timezone.utc) - timedelta(days=1)
time_slice = graph.query_at(yesterday)

print(f"Had {time_slice.entity_count} entities yesterday")
print(f"Has {len(graph.entities)} entities now")
```

### **Get Entity History**

```python
# See all versions of an entity
history = graph.get_entity_history(entity_id)

for version in history:
    print(f"Version from {version.tt_start}: {version.name}")
```

### **List Entities at Time**

```python
# Get entities that existed at a specific time
past = datetime(2025, 10, 1, tzinfo=timezone.utc)
entities = graph.list_entities(as_of=past)
```

---

## Provenance Tracing

Track the lineage of entities through DERIVES_FROM relations:

```python
# Build provenance chain
raw = Entity(type="raw_data", name="Raw Data")
processed = Entity(type="processed", name="Processed Data")
analysis = Entity(type="analysis", name="Analysis")

graph.add_entity(raw)
graph.add_entity(processed)
graph.add_entity(analysis)

# processed derives from raw
r1 = Relation(
    source_id=raw.id,
    target_id=processed.id,
    relation_type=RelationType.DERIVES_FROM
)

# analysis derives from processed
r2 = Relation(
    source_id=processed.id,
    target_id=analysis.id,
    relation_type=RelationType.DERIVES_FROM
)

graph.add_relation(r1)
graph.add_relation(r2)

# Trace provenance
provenance = graph.trace_provenance(analysis.id)
print(f"Analysis derives from {len(provenance)} sources")
```

---

## Contradiction Detection

Automatically detect contradictions via CONTRADICTS relations:

```python
# Add contradicting claims
claim1 = Entity(type="claim", name="Earth is flat")
claim2 = Entity(type="claim", name="Earth is round")

graph.add_entity(claim1)
graph.add_entity(claim2)

# Mark as contradictory
relation = Relation(
    source_id=claim1.id,
    target_id=claim2.id,
    relation_type=RelationType.CONTRADICTS,
    confidence=0.95
)
graph.add_relation(relation)

# Detect contradictions
contradictions = graph.detect_contradictions()

for c in contradictions:
    print(f"Contradiction: {c.explanation}")
    print(f"Confidence: {c.confidence}")
```

---

## Integration with CMC

Evidence can reference CMC atoms:

```python
from cmc_service import MemoryStore, AtomCreate, AtomContent
from seg import Evidence, SEGraph

# Store in CMC
cmc_store = MemoryStore("./data")
atom = cmc_store.create_atom(AtomCreate(
    modality="text",
    content=AtomContent(inline="Important fact"),
    tags={"importance": 1.0}
))

# Reference in SEG
evidence = Evidence(
    content="Important fact",
    source="cmc_memory",
    atom_id=atom.id  # Link to CMC
)

graph = SEGraph()
graph.add_evidence(evidence)

# Now evidence is linked to CMC memory
retrieved_evidence = graph.get_evidence(evidence.id)
print(f"Backed by CMC atom: {retrieved_evidence.atom_id}")
```

---

## Integration with VIF

Track provenance with VIF witnesses:

```python
from vif import VIF
from seg import Entity

# Create VIF witness
witness = VIF(
    witness_id="witness_123",
    timestamp="2025-10-23T...",
    operation="entity_create",
    agent_id="aether",
    inputs={"name": "Machine Learning"},
    outputs={"entity_id": "entity_abc"},
    confidence=0.95
)

# Attach to entity
entity = Entity(
    type="concept",
    name="Machine Learning",
    witness_id=witness.witness_id  # VIF provenance
)
```

---

## Serialization

Export and import graphs:

```python
# Export to dict
data = graph.to_dict()

# Save to JSON
import json
with open("graph.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(data, f, default=str)  # default=str handles datetimes

# Import from dict
restored_graph = SEGraph.from_dict(data)
```

---

## Statistics

Get graph statistics:

```python
stats = graph.stats()

print(f"Entities: {stats['entity_count']}")
print(f"Relations: {stats['relation_count']}")
print(f"Evidence: {stats['evidence_count']}")
print(f"Contradictions: {stats['contradiction_count']}")
```

concepts = graph.list_entities(entity_type="concept")
print(f"Knowledge base has {len(concepts)} concepts")

relations = graph.get_relations(source_id=ml.id)
print(f"ML relates to {len(relations)} other concepts")
