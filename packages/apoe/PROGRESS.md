**Last Updated:** 2025-10-22 03:52 PM  
**Current Status:** 75% complete  
**Tests Passing:** 40/40 ✅  

---

## ✅ **COMPLETED (75%)**

### **Core Components:**
- ✅ **Models** (`models.py`) - RoleType, Step, StepStatus, Budget, Gate
- ✅ **Roles** (`roles.py`) - 8 role types with descriptions and defaults
- ✅ **ACL Parser** (`acl_parser.py`) - Complete grammar support
- ✅ **Executor** (`executor.py`) - DAG execution with dependencies
- ✅ **VIF Integration** (`vif_integration.py`) - Full provenance tracking
- ✅ **Integration Examples** (`integration_examples.py`) - Multi-system workflows
- ✅ **README** (`README.md`) - Complete system overview

### **Capabilities:**
- ✅ Parse ACL language (PLAN/ROLE/STEP/ASSIGN/REQUIRES/BUDGET/GATE)
- ✅ Build execution plans with dependency graphs
- ✅ Execute plans respecting dependencies
- ✅ Validate quality gates before proceeding
- ✅ Track budgets (tokens, time, tools)
- ✅ Fail-fast on errors
- ✅ Generate VIF witnesses for all operations
- ✅ Integration with HHNI/CMC/VIF/SDF-CVF

### **Testing:**
```
Parser tests:      15 ✅
Executor tests:     9 ✅
VIF integration:    6 ✅
Integration examples: 10 ✅
Total:             40 ✅ (100% passing)
```

## ⏳ **REMAINING (25%)**

### **High Priority (Next 10%):**
- ⏳ **Role Dispatch System** - Intelligent role selection and configuration
- ⏳ **Advanced Gates** - Compound conditions, ON_FAIL actions
- ⏳ **CMC Integration** - Memory-aware orchestration
- ⏳ **Error Recovery** - Retry logic, fallback strategies

### **Medium Priority (Next 10%):**
- ⏳ **DEPP** (Dynamic Execution Plan Processor) - Self-rewriting plans
- ⏳ **Parallel Execution** - Concurrent step execution
- ⏳ **Budget Management** - Global budget pools, sharing
- ⏳ **Streaming Results** - Real-time step updates

### **Nice-to-Have (Final 5%):**
- ⏳ **Plan Optimization** - Automatic plan refinement
- ⏳ **Performance Profiling** - Execution analytics
- ⏳ **ACL Linter** - Syntax validation and suggestions
- ⏳ **Visual Plan Editor** - UI for plan creation
