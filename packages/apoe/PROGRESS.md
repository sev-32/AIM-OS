## ⏳ **REMAINING (20%)**

### **High Priority (Next 10%):**
- ⏳ **CMC Integration** - Memory-aware orchestration helpers
- ⏳ **Error Recovery** - Enhanced retry logic, circuit breakers
- ⏳ **Budget Enforcement** - Active budget tracking during execution
- ⏳ **HITL Escalation** - Human-in-the-loop integration

### **Medium Priority (Next 7%):**
- ⏳ **DEPP** (Dynamic Execution Plan Processor) - Self-rewriting plans
- ⏳ **Parallel Execution** - Concurrent step execution
- ⏳ **Budget Pooling** - Shared budget across steps
- ⏳ **Streaming Results** - Real-time step updates

### **Nice-to-Have (Final 3%):**
- ⏳ **Plan Optimization** - Automatic plan refinement
- ⏳ **Performance Profiling** - Execution analytics
- ⏳ **ACL Linter** - Syntax validation and suggestions
- ⏳ **Visual Plan Editor** - UI for plan creation
