# AIM-OS Test Scenarios

**Purpose:** Comprehensive test scenarios to validate AIM-OS promises and capabilities.

**Philosophy:** Test the VISION, not just the code. Validate that promises are real.

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-21 by o3-pro

---

## Core Promises to Test

AIM-OS makes specific promises. Each must be validated:

1. **"It never forgets"** → CMC perfect memory
2. **"It never contradicts"** → SEG coherence checking  
3. **"It shows impact before changes"** → Blast radius foresight
4. **"Ideas evolve seed → deploy"** → MIGE pipeline works
5. **"Every decision has provenance"** → VIF traceability
6. **"Nothing is ever lost"** → SDF-CVF recovery
7. **"It builds things exceptionally"** → **CRITICAL: Can it actually produce quality artifacts?**

---

## Category 1: Memory & Coherence Tests

### Test 1.1: Memory Persistence Across Sessions
**Promise:** "It never forgets"

**Setup:**
1. Session 1: Extended conversation (500+ messages simulated)
   - Discuss fictional "Project Apollo" architecture
   - Make 20 design decisions
   - Record reasoning, evidence, context
2. Store in CMC with varied modalities (decision, reasoning, evidence, context)
3. End session, clear all chat context

**Execution:**
1. Session 2 (fresh context): Query "What decisions did we make about Project Apollo?"
2. Session 3 (another fresh context): Query specific decision "Why did we choose PostgreSQL?"
3. Session 4: Query temporal "What was our thinking about caching on Day 1?"

**Expected Results:**
- Session 2: Retrieves all 20 decisions with context
- Session 3: Provides specific PostgreSQL decision with evidence trail
- Session 4: Retrieves time-specific context accurately

**Success Criteria:**
- ✓ 100% of decisions retrievable
- ✓ Context preserved accurately
- ✓ No degradation across sessions
- ✓ Temporal queries work correctly

**Validation Method:** Automated + Manual (user verifies "feel" of memory quality)

---

### Test 1.2: Contradiction Detection
**Promise:** "It never contradicts"

**Setup:**
1. Record decision: "Use REST API for service communication"
   - Evidence: Team familiarity, simplicity
   - Timestamp: T1
2. Record decision: "Use gRPC for service communication"
   - Evidence: Performance requirements
   - Timestamp: T2 (later than T1)

**Execution:**
1. SEG processes both decisions
2. Detects conflict (REST vs gRPC for same purpose)
3. Presents conflict to user

**Expected Results:**
- Conflict detected automatically
- Both decisions presented with evidence
- Resolution options provided:
  - Keep REST (reject gRPC)
  - Switch to gRPC (revise REST decision with provenance)
  - Both (explain: REST for service A, gRPC for service B)

**Success Criteria:**
- ✓ Conflict detected within seconds
- ✓ Evidence for both sides shown
- ✓ Resolution guidance is actionable
- ✓ Provenance preserved after resolution

**Validation Method:** Automated test with manual validation of guidance quality

---

## Category 2: Governance & Prevention Tests

### Test 2.1: Blast Radius Prevention
**Promise:** "It shows impact before changes"

**Setup:**
1. Create topology:
   ```
   Node A [policy: max_deps=5, current_deps=4]
     ├─ depends on → Node B
     ├─ depends on → Node C
     └─ depends on → Node D
   
   Node X [depends on A]
   Node Y [depends on A]
   Node Z [depends on A, policy: stateless=true]
   ```

**Execution:**
1. Attempt to add dependency: A → Node E
   - Would make A have 5 dependencies (at limit)
2. Attempt to add dependency: A → Node F
   - Would make A have 6 dependencies (violates policy)

**Expected Results:**
- First attempt (A → E): ⚠️ Warning shown, change allowed
  - "You're at policy limit (5/5)"
  - Blast radius: [X, Y, Z] would be affected
- Second attempt (A → F): ❌ Change blocked
  - "Would violate max_deps policy"
  - Blast radius: [X, Y, Z] would be affected, Z would transitively violate
  - 💡 Suggestion: "Refactor to reduce dependencies first"

**Success Criteria:**
- ✓ Blast radius calculated correctly (shows X, Y, Z)
- ✓ Policy violation detected BEFORE change committed
- ✓ Change blocked (not just warned)
- ✓ Alternative solutions suggested

**Validation Method:** Automated test with assert on blocked status

---

### Test 2.2: Policy Cascade Through Dependencies
**Promise:** "Dependencies inherit governance constraints"

**Setup:**
1. Create Node A with policies: [P1: security=high, P2: max_deps=3]
2. Create Node B (no policies initially)
3. Create edge: B → depends_on → A

**Execution:**
1. Edge creation triggers policy inheritance
2. Node B should now inherit [P1, P2]

**Expected Results:**
- Node B automatically has policies [P1, P2]
- If B attempts to violate P2 (add 4 dependencies), blocked
- If attempt to create Node C → depends_on → B, C inherits [P1, P2]
- **Cascade through dependency tree**

**Success Criteria:**
- ✓ Policies inherited on edge creation
- ✓ Cascades through multiple levels (A → B → C)
- ✓ No manual policy assignment needed
- ✓ Violations detected at any level

**Validation Method:** Automated integration test

## Category 5: MIGE Pipeline Tests (WITH FULL AUDITABILITY)

### CRITICAL ADDITION: Auditable Growth

**Not just:** "Can it build?"
**But:** "Can we SEE and DEBUG the growth process?"

**Why this matters:**
- If build fails or is low-quality, we need to know WHERE in the evolution it went wrong
- Was it bad seed? Bad vision tensor? Bad trunk planning? Bad branch specs?
- **Audit trail enables debugging the IDEA EVOLUTION ITSELF**

**What we must validate:**
- Every stage of growth is recorded
- Every decision has provenance
- Every refinement is traceable
- Temporal navigation works (go back to any stage)
- **Can debug "why did the build turn out this way?"**

---

### Test 5.1: Seed → Document Pipeline (With Full Audit Trail)
**Status:** ✅ Automated via `doc_builder` (scripts + tests/test_generator.py); artifact at `Testing/artifacts/test5_1_document.md`.
**Input:** Seed for "REST API Best Practices Guide"

**Pipeline Stages:**
1. Vision Tensor: Validate vision alignment
2. Trunk Plan: Generate outline (sections, topics)
3. Branch Specs: Detailed specifications per section
4. Document Generation: Complete markdown document

**Validation Points:**
- After Vision Tensor: Is alignment score reasonable? (>0.8)
- After Trunk: Is outline complete? (all major topics covered)
- After Branch: Are specs detailed enough? (subsections, key points)
- After Generation: Is document actually good? (complete, accurate, useful)

**Success Criteria:**
- ✓ Each stage produces expected output
- ✓ Policies propagate (technical_accuracy maintained)
- ✓ Quality improves through stages (refinement visible)
- ✓ Final document is exceptional quality

**AUDIT TRAIL Validation:**
- ✓ Can view seed → tensor → trunk → branch → document progression
- ✓ Can navigate backward: "Why did section X get structured this way?"
  - Trace back: Document ← Branch spec ← Trunk outline ← Vision tensor ← Seed
- ✓ Can identify where issues originated:
  - If document is incomplete → Trace back to trunk outline (was it underspecified?)
  - If document is off-topic → Trace back to vision tensor (did alignment fail?)
  - If document violates policy → Trace back to where policy was ignored
- ✓ Can fix at the right level:
  - Bad seed → Refine seed and regenerate
  - Bad tensor → Adjust vision axes and recalculate
  - Bad trunk → Refine outline and rebuild branches
  - Bad branch → Adjust specs and regenerate document only
  - **Fix the IDEA LEVEL where error originated, not the symptom**

## Category 6: Exceptional Build Quality Tests

### Test 6.1: Build vs. Human Comparison
**Promise:** "AIM-OS builds things exceptionally, not just adequately"

**Test Approach:**
1. Generate component with AIM-OS (e.g., "UserService")
2. Have experienced developer build same component
3. Compare on quality dimensions

**Comparison Metrics:**
- Completeness (AIM-OS includes edge cases human forgot?)
- Test coverage (AIM-OS vs human coverage %)
- Security (static analysis: AIM-OS vs human vulnerabilities)
- Documentation (AIM-OS vs human doc quality)
- Time to build (AIM-OS: minutes, Human: hours)

**Success Criteria:**
- ✓ AIM-OS is comparable or better on most metrics
- ✓ AIM-OS is significantly faster
- ✓ Quality is "exceptional" not just "adequate"

**Validation Method:** Side-by-side comparison (user assesses)

---

### Test 6.2: Build Consistency
**Promise:** "Multiple builds of same idea produce consistent quality"

**Test Approach:**
1. Run same seed through MIGE 5 times independently
2. Compare outputs on quality dimensions

**Expected:**
- Core architecture should be similar (deterministic choices)
- Implementation details may vary (acceptable variance)
- Quality should be consistent (all meet targets)

**Success Criteria:**
- ✓ Quality variance is low (all builds meet targets)
- ✓ No random regressions (one build isn't significantly worse)
- ✓ Core decisions are stable (architecture doesn't randomly change)

**Validation Method:** Automated comparison of 5 independent builds

---

### Test 6.3: Incremental Refinement
**Promise:** "Ideas improve through iteration"

**Test Approach:**
1. Generate document from seed
2. User provides feedback: "Add more code examples"
3. System refines (adds examples)
4. User provides feedback: "Explain error handling better"
5. System refines again

**Expected:**
- Each iteration improves the artifact
- Previous quality is preserved (no regressions)
- Feedback is incorporated accurately
- **Refinement converges on exceptional quality**

**Success Criteria:**
- ✓ Each iteration measurably improves (more examples, better explanations)
- ✓ No quality regressions (previous good content preserved)
- ✓ Feedback understood and applied correctly
- ✓ Converges (after N iterations, further feedback yields diminishing returns)

**Validation Method:**
- Manual: User provides real feedback, assesses improvements

---

## Category 7: Real-World Workflow Tests

### Test 7.1: "The Forgetful Developer" (E2E Scenario)
**Story:** Developer works on feature across multiple days/sessions

**Day 1 - Session 1:**
1. Developer discusses authentication requirements
2. Makes decision: Use JWT
3. Records reasoning: Simplicity, no SSO needed
4. **AIM-OS stores in CMC**

**Day 3 - Session 2 (fresh context):**
1. Developer asks: "What did we decide about auth?"
2. **AIM-OS retrieves from CMC:** "You chose JWT on Day 1 because..."
3. Developer continues design based on JWT decision
4. **No re-explanation needed**

**Day 5 - Session 3:**
1. Product manager suggests: "We need SSO now"
2. Developer asks: "Should we switch to OAuth?"
3. **AIM-OS detects:** Contradicts Day 1 JWT decision
4. **AIM-OS presents:** Original reasoning vs. new requirement
5. Developer makes informed choice: Revise to OAuth
6. **AIM-OS updates:** Provenance trail shows decision evolution

**Validation:**
- ✓ Memory persisted across 3 sessions
- ✓ Context never re-explained
- ✓ Contradiction detected
- ✓ Evolution tracked with provenance
- ✓ Developer experience: "Continuous conversation"

---

### Test 7.2: "The Breaking Change" (E2E Scenario)
**Story:** Developer about to break production, AIM-OS prevents it

**Setup:**
- Production system with 50 components
- Component "AuthService" has 4 dependencies (policy: max=5)
- 12 components depend on AuthService

**Developer Action:**
1. Developer: "I want to add Redis caching to AuthService"
2. **AIM-OS analyzes:**
   - Would add 2 dependencies (Redis + CacheManager)
   - Total: 6 dependencies (violates max=5 policy)
   - Blast radius: 12 dependent components affected
   - 3 components would transitively violate policies

**Expected System Response:**
```
⚠️ Change Impact Analysis:

Proposed: Add Redis + CacheManager to AuthService
├─ Current: 4 dependencies
├─ Proposed: 6 dependencies
└─ Policy: max=5 ❌ VIOLATION

Blast Radius: 12 components affected
├─ UserController (safe)
├─ AdminPanel (safe)
├─ SessionManager ⚠️ (would exceed its own dependency limit)
└─ ... [9 more]

❌ Change BLOCKED - would violate governance

💡 Alternatives:
1. Create separate CachingService (no violation)
2. Remove 1 existing dependency first
3. Request policy override (requires justification)

[View full blast radius graph]
```

**Developer Experience:**
1. Sees problem BEFORE making change
2. Understands impact (12 components, 3 violations)
3. Gets actionable alternatives
4. Chooses option 1 (separate CachingService)
5. **Production breakage prevented**

**Validation:**
- ✓ Blast radius correct (found all 12 dependents)
- ✓ Policy violation detected (before change)
- ✓ Alternatives are sensible
- ✓ Developer prevented from breaking production
- ✓ User feels: "The system saved me from disaster"

---

### Test 7.3: "The Evolving Product" (E2E Scenario)
**Story:** Product evolves from vague idea to shipped application

**Week 1 - Seed:**
```
Idea: "Build something for project management"
Vision: "Simple, collaborative, fast"
```

**Week 2 - Refinement:**
- MIGE asks: What features are essential?
- Developer specifies: Tasks, assignments, due dates
- Vision Tensor: Aligns, produces quality axes
- **Seed refined**

**Week 3 - Architecture:**
- Trunk plan: System architecture generated
- Blast radius: Shows dependencies, constraints
- Developer reviews: "Looks good, proceed"
- **Architecture validated**

**Week 4 - Implementation:**
- Branch specs: Detailed feature specifications
- Code generation: Backend + Frontend
- Tests: Comprehensive coverage
- **Working application**

**Week 5 - Refinement:**
- User feedback: "Add real-time updates"
- System integrates: WebSocket layer added
- Blast radius: Shows impact (3 components affected, all safe)
- **Feature added without breaking**

**Week 6 - Ship:**
- All tests passing
- Documentation complete
- Deployment artifacts ready
- **Shipped to production**

**Validation:**
- ✓ Idea evolved naturally (seed → shipped product)
- ✓ Quality maintained throughout
- ✓ Policies enforced at every stage
- ✓ Vision alignment preserved
- ✓ Delivered in 6 weeks (would traditionally take months)
- ✓ Developer feels: "The system guided me to the right solution"

- [x] Bidirectional feedback loops work (analysis ↔ validation)
- [x] Retry logic triggers on failures
- [x] Policies enforced (depth, evidence threshold, timeout)
- [x] **Can actually run and produce research reports**
- [x] Audit trail shows full execution (which agent called which, when)

**Evidence:** 
- Audit trail: `Testing/artifacts/test8_1_research_orchestrator/research_orchestrator/audit/orchestration_run.json`
- Outputs: `Testing/artifacts/test8_1_research_orchestrator/research_orchestrator/outputs/`

**Success Criteria:**

## Category 9: AUDIT TRAIL Tests (ENABLES DEBUGGING EVOLUTION)

### Test 9.1: Trace Quality Degradation to Source
**Scenario:** Generated artifact has quality issue - find WHERE it originated

**Test:**
1. Generate documentation from seed
2. Document has flaw: "Security section is too shallow (only 2 paragraphs)"
3. Use audit trail to trace backward:

**Audit Investigation:**
```
Step 1: Inspect Document (current output)
  Issue: Security section is shallow
  
Step 2: Trace to Branch Specs
  Query: "What did branch specs say about security section?"
  Finding: Branch spec said "Security: Cover basic authentication"
  ⚠️ Problem: "basic authentication" is underspecified
  
Step 3: Trace to Trunk Outline
  Query: "What did trunk plan say about security?"
  Finding: Trunk outline listed "Security section" with no detail
  ⚠️ Problem: Trunk didn't emphasize security depth
  
Step 4: Trace to Vision Tensor
  Query: "What was security's weight in vision tensor?"
  Finding: Security axis weight = 0.3 (low)
  🔴 ROOT CAUSE: Vision tensor didn't prioritize security
  
Step 5: Trace to Seed
  Query: "What did seed say about security?"
  Finding: Seed said "secure" but didn't emphasize it
  🔴 ROOT CAUSE: Seed underspecified security importance
```

**Fix at Root:**
1. Modify seed: "Vision: Clear, comprehensive, **security-critical**"
2. Regenerate vision tensor: Security axis weight → 0.9 (high)
3. Trunk plan regenerates: Security section gets detailed outline
4. Branch specs regenerate: Security section gets 10+ subsections
5. Document regenerates: Security section is comprehensive (8 pages)
6. ✓ Issue fixed at ROOT CAUSE

**Success Criteria:**
- ✓ Can trace quality issue backward through all stages
- ✓ Can identify root cause (seed underspecification)
- ✓ Can fix at appropriate level (seed, not document)
- ✓ Regeneration from corrected stage produces better output
- ✓ **Debugging the IDEA EVOLUTION works**

### Test 9.2: Temporal Navigation & Alternate Timelines
**Scenario:** Experiment with "what if we had chosen differently?"

**Test:**
1. Generate application from seed (Task Management System)
2. Evolution stages:
   - T0: Seed
   - T+5min: Vision Tensor (score: 0.88)
   - T+15min: Trunk Plan v1 (chose REST API)
   - T+20min: Trunk Plan v2 (refinement)
   - T+30min: Branch Specs
   - T+60min: Complete Application (REST-based)

3. Navigate to T+15min (Trunk Plan v1)
4. Modify: Choose GraphQL instead of REST
5. Replay from T+15min with modification
6. New timeline:
   - T+15min: Trunk Plan v1-alt (GraphQL chosen)
   - T+20min: Trunk Plan v2-alt (refined for GraphQL)
   - T+30min: Branch Specs-alt (GraphQL schemas)
   - T+60min: Complete Application-alt (GraphQL-based)

7. Compare timelines:
   - Original (REST) vs Alternate (GraphQL)
   - Which is better for the requirements?

**Success Criteria:**
- ✓ Can rewind to any stage
- ✓ Can modify at any stage
- ✓ Can replay from modification point
- ✓ Both timelines preserved (can compare)
- ✓ Quality assessment for both (which is better?)
- ✓ **Temporal experimentation enables finding optimal path**

**UI for Temporal Navigation:**

### Test 9.3: Full Build Audit (Every Decision Traceable)
**Scenario:** Application built - audit EVERY decision

**Test:**
1. Generate "Task Management System" (50+ components)
2. Audit questions (must be answerable for ANY aspect):

**Architecture decisions:**
- Q: "Why microservices instead of monolith?"
  - A: Vision tensor prioritized scalability (weight=0.9)
  - Evidence: Seed specified "must scale to 100K users"
  - Decision made at: Trunk planning stage
  - Alternatives considered: Monolith (rejected: doesn't scale), Serverless (rejected: complexity)

**Implementation decisions:**
- Q: "Why PostgreSQL instead of MongoDB?"
  - A: Relational data model required (task relationships)
  - Evidence: Trunk plan identified relational needs
  - Decision made at: Trunk planning stage
  - Policy: enterprise_db=true (PostgreSQL satisfies, MongoDB doesn't)

**Code structure decisions:**
- Q: "Why does TaskService have exactly 4 dependencies?"
  - A: Branch specs identified: DB, Cache, Notifications, Logging
  - Policy: max_dependencies=5 (4 is under limit)
  - Each dependency justified by functional requirements

**Test coverage decisions:**
- Q: "Why 47 test cases for TaskService?"
  - A: Branch specs enumerated edge cases
  - Policy: test_coverage>80% drove comprehensive testing
  - Coverage achieved: 92%

**Quality decisions:**
- Q: "Why use repository pattern?"
  - A: Vision prioritized testability + maintainability
  - Architectural decision from trunk plan
  - Evidence: Best practice for testable persistence

**Success Criteria:**
- ✓ 100% of architectural decisions are traceable
- ✓ 100% of implementation decisions have provenance
- ✓ Reasoning chains are complete (no gaps)
- ✓ Alternatives considered are documented
- ✓ Can answer "why?" for ANY aspect of the build
- ✓ **Full auditability of the entire system**

- Integration tests for core flows
- **Validate: Components work individually and together**

### Phase 2: E2E Pipeline Tests (Weeks 3-4)
- Document generation tests
- Component generation tests  
- Application generation tests
- **Validate: MIGE builds things end-to-end**

### Phase 3: Quality Assessment (Weeks 5-6)
- Code quality metrics
- Documentation quality assessment
- Build consistency testing
- **Validate: Quality is exceptional, not just functional**

### Phase 4: Real-World Scenarios (Weeks 7-8)
- Full workflow simulations
- User validation sessions
- Performance benchmarking
- **Validate: Works in real development context**

## Next Steps

**Immediate:**
1. ✅ Test 1.1 automated (Memory persistence)
2. ✅ Test 2.1 automated (Blast-radius prevention)
3. Create automated test suite structure
2. Implement Test 1.1 (Memory Persistence) as first E2E test
3. Implement Test 2.1 (Blast Radius Prevention) as second E2E test
4. **Prove core promises work**

**Then:**
5. Build quality tests (document, component, application generation)
6. Manual validation guides (for user "feeling" tests)
7. Performance benchmarks
8. **Complete validation suite**

**Testing validates the VISION.**
**Not just that code runs.**
**But that promises are REAL.**

**"It never forgets" → Prove it**
**"It builds things exceptionally" → Prove it**
**"Debug before it happens" → Prove it**

**12-24 months to perfect IDE.**
**Starting with proving it works.** ⚡
