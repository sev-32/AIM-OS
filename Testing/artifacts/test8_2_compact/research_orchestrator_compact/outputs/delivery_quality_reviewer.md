Okay, this is a good, concise description of the "Quality Reviewer" role within a delivery and QA stage. Let's break it down and discuss how we can make it even more robust.

**Understanding the Role**

The primary Quality Reviewer is responsible for ensuring that the delivered product or service meets quality standards by:

*   **Alignment and Governance:** Verifying that the evidence presented supports the claims and aligns with governance requirements.
*   **Policy Adherence:** Operating within the defined boundaries of orchestration policies (latency, research depth, evidence threshold, etc.).
*   **Objective Reporting:**  Providing a clear summary, confidence score, and recommendation based on the review.

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Objectives:** The "Objectives" section provides a straightforward understanding of the reviewer's goals.
*   **Policy Context:** Listing the relevant policies is crucial for ensuring the reviewer understands the constraints and guidelines.
*   **Well-Defined Outputs:**  The "Required Outputs" clearly specify the deliverables expected from the reviewer.

**Areas for Potential Improvement & Expansion:**

Here's how we can enhance this role description:

1.  **Specificity in Evidence Alignment:**  Elaborate on what constitutes "evidence alignment." What types of evidence are expected? What criteria are used to determine alignment? Examples would be extremely helpful.

    *   **Example:** "Evidence alignment includes verifying that test results support claimed performance metrics, user feedback aligns with design specifications, and security audits confirm compliance with security policies."

2.  **Examples of Governance Compliance:**  What specific governance standards are being referenced (e.g., SOX, HIPAA, GDPR)? How is compliance verified?

    *   **Example:** "Governance compliance refers to adherence to GDPR regulations, ensuring data privacy and security measures are in place, as evidenced by documented security protocols and audit reports."

3.  **Clarify "Orchestration Policies":**  "Orchestration policies" is a broad term. Providing more context or examples would be beneficial. What types of actions are governed by these policies?

    *   **Example:** "Orchestration policies control the depth of research conducted to gather supporting evidence (policy.research_depth), limit the time spent on investigation (policy.latency_budget), and establish minimum acceptable levels of evidence (policy.evidence_threshold)."

4.  **Elaborate on "Structured Summary":**  Define the structure or format of the summary. What key information should be included?  Perhaps a template or outline could be provided.

    *   **Example:** "The structured summary should include sections for (1) Key Findings, (2) Evidence Analysis, (3) Policy Compliance Assessment, and (4) Recommendation."

5.  **Confidence Score Definition:**  How is the confidence score calculated? What scale is used? What factors influence the score?  A rubric would be highly valuable.

    *   **Example:** "The confidence score is rated on a scale of 1-10, with 1 being low confidence and 10 being high confidence.  Factors influencing the score include the quantity and quality of evidence, the consistency of findings, and the reviewer's professional judgment.  A confidence score of 7 or higher is generally required to proceed without further investigation."

6.  **Examples of Supporting Evidence Identifiers:** What does "evidence identifier" refer to?

    *   **Example:** "Evidence identifiers may include file names of test reports, issue tracker ticket numbers, links to relevant documentation, or citations of specific policy requirements."

7.  **More Concrete Examples of "Next-Step Recommendation or Escalation Flag":** Provide specific scenarios that would trigger escalation.

    *   **Example:**
        *   **Next-Step Recommendation:** "Recommend additional testing in area X to address identified vulnerability."
        *   **Escalation Flag:** "Escalate to the security team due to potential violation of GDPR data privacy requirements based on audit report XYZ."

8.  **Skills & Qualifications (Optional):**  While not strictly part of the role's responsibilities, including a section outlining the desired skills and qualifications of a Quality Reviewer would be helpful for staffing.

    *   **Example:** "Ideal candidates should possess: Strong analytical skills, experience with [relevant technology/domain], understanding of [relevant compliance regulations], and excellent communication skills."

Stage: Delivery & QA

## Objectives
- Maintain evidence alignment and governance compliance, ensuring that all claims are supported by robust evidence and adhere to established standards (e.g., GDPR, SOX).
- Respect orchestration policies (latency, research depth, evidence thresholds) while completing assigned actions.

## Policy Context
- policy.evidence_threshold
- policy.latency_budget
- policy.research_depth
- policy.seed.evidence_threshold
- policy.seed.max_research_depth
- policy.seed.max_total_time

## Detailed Expectations

*   **Evidence Alignment:** Verify that all evidence presented supports the stated claims. This includes ensuring test results align with performance metrics, user feedback is consistent with design specifications, and security audits confirm compliance with security policies.
*   **Governance Compliance:**  Adhere to relevant governance standards (e.g., GDPR), ensuring data privacy and security measures are in place.  Compliance is verified through documented security protocols and audit reports.
*   **Orchestration Policies:** Operate within defined orchestration policy limits. For example, limit the time spent on evidence gathering (policy.latency_budget) and adhere to minimum evidence thresholds (policy.evidence_threshold).

## Required Outputs
- **Structured Summary of Findings:** This summary should include:
    *   **Key Findings:** A concise overview of the review's main conclusions.
    *   **Evidence Analysis:** A detailed assessment of the strength and relevance of the supporting evidence.
    *   **Policy Compliance Assessment:**  A determination of whether the product/service complies with relevant policies.
    *   **Recommendation:** A clear recommendation for next steps.
- **Confidence Score (1-10) with Supporting Evidence Identifiers:** The confidence score reflects the certainty of the findings based on the available evidence. The scale is 1-10 (1=low, 10=high). Factors influencing the score include the quantity and quality of evidence, consistency of findings, and reviewer judgment. Evidence identifiers (e.g., file names of test reports, issue tracker ticket numbers) should be provided to support the assigned confidence score.
- **Next-Step Recommendation or Escalation Flag:**
    *   **Next-Step Recommendation Examples:** "Recommend additional testing in area X" or "Request clarification on requirement Y from the product owner."
    *   **Escalation Flag Examples:** "Escalate to the security team due to a potential GDPR violation based on audit report XYZ" or "Escalate to the legal team due to non-compliance with contract terms outlined in document ABC."

By adding this level of detail, you provide a clearer and more actionable definition of the Quality Reviewer role, minimizing ambiguity and maximizing the effectiveness of the review process. Remember to tailor the examples to your specific organization and context.
