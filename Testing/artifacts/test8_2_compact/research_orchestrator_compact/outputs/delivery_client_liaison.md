Okay, I understand. As the Client Liaison, my primary function within the Delivery & QA stage is to ensure that all activities related to client interaction and information gathering are performed in a compliant and efficient manner.  I will adhere to the defined policies, especially those related to evidence and time constraints. My goal is to deliver a concise, actionable summary with a confidence score based on the evidence I gather.

Here's a breakdown of how I will approach my tasks:

**1. Understanding the Policies:**

*   **policy.evidence_threshold:** This defines the minimum amount of evidence required to support a conclusion. I will ensure I gather enough evidence to meet this threshold.
*   **policy.latency_budget:**  This dictates the acceptable time frame for completing my tasks. I will prioritize efficiency and adhere to this timeline.
*   **policy.research_depth:** This limits the depth of my research. I will focus on relevant sources and avoid excessive exploration.
*   **policy.seed.evidence_threshold:** This likely refers to the initial seed information provided.  I will assess the existing evidence and determine what additional information is needed to reach the overall evidence threshold.
*   **policy.seed.max_research_depth:** This limits the depth of research allowed based on the initial seed information. I will prioritize information directly related to the initial seed and adhere to this depth.
*   **policy.seed.max_total_time:** This sets the maximum allowed time for all research and analysis, based on the initial seed information. I will ensure all research and analysis are completed within this time frame.

**2.  Performing Assigned Actions:**

*   I will complete assigned tasks related to client communication, data gathering, and information analysis.
*   I will document all evidence gathered, including source identifiers, for traceability and auditability.
*   I will ensure all activities align with the defined orchestration policies and governance requirements.

**3. Generating Required Outputs:**

*   **Structured Summary of Findings:** I will create a concise summary of my findings, highlighting key information and insights. This will be organized for easy understanding.
*   **Confidence Score with Supporting Evidence Identifiers:**  I will assign a confidence score based on the quantity and quality of evidence gathered.  I will explicitly list the identifiers (e.g., document IDs, conversation logs, etc.) of the evidence supporting the confidence score. This allows for easy verification and validation.
*   **Next-Step Recommendation or Escalation Flag:** Based on my findings, I will recommend the next appropriate action. If I encounter issues that require attention beyond my scope, I will flag the case for escalation with a clear explanation of the reason.

**Example Scenario:**

Let's say my task is to gather information about a client's satisfaction with a recently deployed feature.

1.  **Gathering Evidence:** I might:
    *   Review recent customer support tickets related to the feature (evidence ID: Ticket-1234, Ticket-5678).
    *   Analyze feedback from a recent customer survey (evidence ID: Survey-Results-Q3).
    *   Review usage data for the feature (evidence ID: Usage-Data-Dashboard-Oct).
    *   Conduct a targeted interview with a key client representative (evidence ID: Interview-Notes-John-Doe).

2.  **Analyzing Evidence and Applying Policies:** I would then analyze this data, keeping in mind the `evidence_threshold`, `latency_budget`, and `research_depth` policies. If the evidence suggests a low satisfaction level and I've reached the `evidence_threshold` within the `latency_budget`, I'll move to the next step.

3.  **Generating Outputs:**

    *   **Structured Summary:** "Client feedback on the new feature indicates moderate dissatisfaction, primarily due to [Specific Issue 1] and [Specific Issue 2]. Usage data is also slightly below projected levels."
    *   **Confidence Score:**  75% (Evidence IDs: Ticket-1234, Ticket-5678, Survey-Results-Q3, Usage-Data-Dashboard-Oct)
    *   **Next-Step Recommendation:** "Recommend scheduling a follow-up call with the client to address concerns regarding [Specific Issue 1] and [Specific Issue 2]. Suggest investigating potential usability improvements to the feature."

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Traceability:**  Meticulous record-keeping of evidence sources is crucial.
*   **Objectivity:**  I will strive for an unbiased analysis of the evidence.
*   **Communication:** I will communicate clearly and concisely in my summaries and recommendations.
*   **Adaptability:**  I understand that situations can change, and I will be adaptable in my approach while still adhering to policies.

By following this approach, I aim to be a valuable asset in the Delivery & QA stage, ensuring client satisfaction, compliance, and efficient execution.  I am ready to execute on assigned tasks and contribute to the overall success of the project.
