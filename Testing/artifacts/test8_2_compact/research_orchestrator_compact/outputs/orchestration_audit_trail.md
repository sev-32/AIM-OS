Okay, based on the previous descriptions of "Intake & Scoping Coordinator," "Investigation Coordinator," and "Delivery & QA Coordinator," we can now define the "Audit Trail Emitter :: Audit Trail Primary" role within the "Global Orchestration" stage. This role is focused on capturing and managing the *metadata* related to audit trails for all other processes in your system.

**Role: Audit Trail Emitter :: Audit Trail Primary**

**Stage: Global Orchestration**

**Overall Purpose:** This role is responsible for centrally and automatically capturing, structuring, and enriching audit trail data generated by various stages (Intake, Investigation, Delivery, etc.) within the overall system. The aim is to create a comprehensive, consistent, and reliable audit trail to ensure governance, compliance, and system observability. This role doesn't *interpret* the audit trail data; it *ensures it exists and is accessible*.

**Objectives:**

*   **Maintain evidence alignment and governance compliance:**
    *   **Capture Complete Metadata:** Ensure that all relevant actions, events, and decisions within the system are captured in the audit trail, along with relevant metadata (timestamps, user IDs, evidence identifiers, policy references, context data, etc.).
    *   **Enforce Standardized Format:** Enforce a consistent and standardized format for all audit trail entries, regardless of the source or stage of the process. This is crucial for consistent analysis and reporting.
    *   **Ensure Immutability:**  Guarantee the integrity and immutability of the audit trail data. This may involve using techniques like cryptographic hashing, blockchain, or write-once storage.
    *   **Meet Retention Requirements:** Enforce data retention policies as defined by governance requirements.
*   **Respect orchestration policies while completing assigned actions:**
    *   **Automated Capture:** Automate the capture of audit trail data as much as possible to minimize manual effort and ensure completeness.
    *   **Low Latency:** Capture audit data with minimal latency to provide near real-time visibility into system activity.
    *   **Non-Intrusive:** Ensure that audit trail capture has minimal impact on the performance and functionality of other processes.
    *   **Policy Enforcement:** Adhere to policies related to data privacy, security, and access control when handling audit trail data.
*   **Enable Audit and Observability:**  Make the audit trail data readily accessible to authorized users and systems for auditing, analysis, and troubleshooting.

**Policy Context:**

*   **`policy.evidence_threshold`:** While this role doesn't directly use this policy for decision-making, it *records* information about whether this threshold was met during different processes.
*   **`policy.latency_budget`:** The audit trail emission process should have its own latency budget to ensure timely recording of events. The process of recording the audit trail cannot significantly delay the main workflow.
*   **`policy.research_depth`:**  This role doesn't use `policy.research_depth` for investigation, but it *records* the `policy.research_depth` associated with different investigations.
*   **`policy.seed.evidence_threshold`**, **`policy.seed.max_research_depth`**, **`policy.seed.max_total_time`**:  Similar to `policy.evidence_threshold`, this role *records* information about these "seed" policies and their application.
*   **`policy.stage_alignment`:** The audit trail must clearly indicate which stage generated the audit event, supporting overall process alignment.
*   **`policy.system_observability`:** The audit trail data must be structured and accessible in a way that facilitates system-wide observability and monitoring.
*   **`policy.system_fallbacks`:**  Define fallback mechanisms in case of audit trail capture failures (e.g., buffering data, sending alerts).

**Required Outputs:**

*   **Structured Audit Trail Entries:**  Each audit trail entry should include the following information (as a minimum):
    *   **Timestamp:** When the event occurred.
    *   **Event Type:**  A standardized code or description of the event (e.g., "Evidence Collected," "Decision Made," "Task Assigned").
    *   **User ID:** The user who initiated the action or event.
    *   **Source System/Stage:**  The system or stage that generated the event (e.g., "Intake," "Investigation," "Delivery").
    *   **Correlation IDs:**  Identifiers that link the event to related events or processes (e.g., Investigation ID, Case ID, Task ID).
    *   **Evidence Identifiers:** References to any relevant evidence items (e.g., document IDs, database record IDs).
    *   **Policy References:** Identifiers for any policies that were applied or violated (e.g., `policy.evidence_threshold`, `policy.latency_budget`).
    *   **Context Data:**  Any additional relevant data that provides context for the event (e.g., decision outcome, risk score, reason for escalation).
*   **Audit Trail Schema Definition:**  A clearly defined and documented schema for the audit trail data to ensure consistency and interoperability.
*   **Audit Trail API/Interface:**  A well-defined API or interface for accessing and querying the audit trail data.
*   **Audit Trail Monitoring and Alerting:**  Monitoring systems and alerts to detect potential issues with audit trail capture (e.g., data loss, unauthorized access).

**Example Scenario:**

An Investigation Coordinator makes a decision to escalate a case due to exceeding the `policy.latency_budget`.  The Audit Trail Emitter would capture an audit entry with the following information:

*   **Timestamp:** 2023-10-27 10:00:00 UTC
*   **Event Type:** Case Escalated
*   **User ID:** investigation_coordinator_123
*   **Source System/Stage:** Investigation
*   **Correlation IDs:** Case ID: CASE-456, Task ID: TASK-789
*   **Evidence Identifiers:**  (Optional, could include identifiers for relevant documents or data points)
*   **Policy References:** `policy.latency_budget`
*   **Context Data:**  Reason for Escalation: Exceeded Latency Budget (15 days over budget)

**Key Skills:**

*   **Data Modeling:** Ability to design and implement a robust and scalable audit trail schema.
*   **Software Development:**  Proficiency in programming languages and tools for building and integrating with various systems.
*   **Security:** Understanding of security principles and best practices for protecting sensitive data.
*   **Data Management:**  Experience with data storage, retrieval, and archiving.
*   **Automation:**  Ability to automate audit trail capture and processing.
*   **Knowledge of Compliance Requirements:** Understanding of relevant regulations and standards related to data privacy and security (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2).

**Distinguishing Characteristics:**

*   **Centralized Role:** The Audit Trail Emitter acts as a central point for audit trail capture across all stages.
*   **Automation Focus:**  Emphasis on automating the capture and management of audit data.
*   **Schema Enforcement:**  Strong focus on enforcing a consistent audit trail schema to ensure data quality and interoperability.
*   **Observability Enablement:**  Primary goal is to provide the data necessary for comprehensive system observability.

By defining this role, you create a dedicated function responsible for ensuring the existence and integrity of audit trails, which are essential for governance, compliance, and understanding the overall behavior of your system.  It's critical to ensure the Audit Trail Emitter's implementation is itself thoroughly audited and secured.
