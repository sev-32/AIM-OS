Okay, this document outlines the role of the "Policy Gate Sentry Primary" within a system. Let's break down each section and discuss how this role would likely operate:

**Overall Purpose:**

The Policy Gate Sentry's primary function is to **ensure actions taken by the system adhere to established policies and maintain a robust, auditable trail of evidence**. It acts as a gatekeeper, preventing actions that violate policy constraints while simultaneously guiding the system towards compliance.  It's like a compliance officer embedded within the workflow.

**Stage: Rapid Triage**

This context indicates that the Policy Gate Sentry is operating at an early stage in a process.  "Rapid Triage" suggests it's quickly assessing the situation to determine if a more in-depth analysis is required or if the action can proceed. This means:

*   **Speed is a priority.** The analysis must be performed efficiently.
*   **High-level check:** It's likely focusing on the most critical policy requirements at this stage.
*   **Decision Point:** The outcome will determine the next steps - whether to proceed, require further investigation, or escalate.

**Objectives (In Detail):**

*   **Maintain evidence alignment and governance compliance:** This is the core objective.  It means ensuring that:
    *   Every action taken is supported by evidence (data, logs, audit trails, etc.).
    *   This evidence demonstrates adherence to relevant governance policies and regulations.
    *   There's a clear and traceable link between the action, the evidence, and the applicable policies.
*   **Respect orchestration policies while completing assigned actions:**  This implies the system is part of a larger orchestrated workflow, potentially managed by a different component or service.  The Sentry must:
    *   Be aware of the broader orchestration rules and constraints.
    *   Ensure that its actions don't disrupt or violate these orchestration policies.
    *   Operate within the boundaries set by the orchestration system.

**Policy Context (Crucial for Operation):**

These are the specific policies that the Policy Gate Sentry is responsible for enforcing.  Let's examine each one:

*   **`policy.evidence_threshold`**: This likely defines the minimum amount or quality of evidence required to support a particular action.  It might be a numerical threshold (e.g., "requires at least 3 supporting data points") or a qualitative assessment (e.g., "evidence must be considered 'strong' according to a defined rubric"). The Sentry will evaluate the available evidence against this threshold.
*   **`policy.latency_budget`**: This imposes a time constraint on the Sentry's analysis. The "Rapid Triage" stage reinforces this. The Sentry must complete its assessment within the allocated time budget. Exceeding the budget could indicate a problem or require escalation.  This is particularly relevant in automated systems where speed is critical.
*   **`policy.research_depth`**: This limits the amount of research or investigation the Sentry can perform to gather evidence.  This is also tied to the "Rapid Triage" concept.  It prevents the Sentry from getting bogged down in excessive investigation.  It might be expressed as a number of queries, the number of evidence sources to consult, or a time limit for research.
*   **`policy.seed.evidence_threshold`**: This policy likely applies specifically to the initial data or "seed" information used to trigger the process. It specifies the minimum evidence required to consider the seed data valid and proceed with further processing.  Think of it as validating the initial input.
*   **`policy.seed.max_research_depth`**:  Similar to `policy.research_depth`, but specific to validating the initial "seed" data.  It limits the amount of investigation that can be done to verify the seed data's validity.
*   **`policy.seed.max_total_time`**:  Limits the total time spent on the initial validation of the seed data.  Again, emphasizes the importance of speed in the initial triage phase.

**Required Outputs (The deliverables):**

*   **Structured summary of findings:**  A concise, organized report outlining the results of the policy compliance assessment. This should include:
    *   Which policies were evaluated.
    *   The evidence that was considered.
    *   Whether the policies were met (or not).
    *   Any exceptions or deviations observed.
*   **Confidence score with supporting evidence identifiers:**  A numerical or qualitative measure of confidence in the assessment, accompanied by references to the specific pieces of evidence that support the score.  This is crucial for auditability and traceability.  Examples of evidence identifiers could be log file names, database record IDs, or API call timestamps.
*   **Next-step recommendation or escalation flag:** Based on the findings, the Sentry must recommend the appropriate next action:
    *   **Next-step recommendation:** "Proceed to Stage 2," "Refine seed data based on findings," etc.
    *   **Escalation flag:** Indicate that a policy violation has occurred, a critical error has been detected, or the situation requires human intervention.  This might trigger an alert or assign the task to a human analyst.

**In Summary:**

The Policy Gate Sentry Primary plays a critical role in automated compliance. It's responsible for quickly evaluating actions against a set of policies, ensuring sufficient evidence is present, and making informed decisions about whether to proceed, investigate further, or escalate.  It must operate efficiently, respecting time constraints and limits on research depth, while maintaining a strong focus on evidence alignment and auditability.  Its success hinges on its ability to effectively interpret and enforce the defined policies.
