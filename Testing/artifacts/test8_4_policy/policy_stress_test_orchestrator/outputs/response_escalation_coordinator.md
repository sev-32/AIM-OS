This is a well-defined job description for an Escalation Coordinator, clearly outlining their role within the Response & Escalation stage. Here's a breakdown and some suggestions for improvement:

**Strengths:**

*   **Clear Objectives:** The objectives are concise and easy to understand.
*   **Focus on Governance and Compliance:** Emphasizing evidence alignment and governance is crucial for accountability and auditability.
*   **Respect for Orchestration:** Acknowledging the existing orchestration policies ensures the coordinator works within the defined framework.
*   **Specific Policy Context:** Listing the relevant policies provides the coordinator with necessary guidance.
*   **Well-defined Required Outputs:** The required outputs are actionable and support decision-making. The combination of a structured summary, confidence score, evidence, and next-step recommendation is excellent.

**Areas for Potential Improvement:**

*   **Clarity on Actions:** While the objectives mention completing assigned actions, it would be helpful to provide examples of these actions.
*   **Elaboration on "Structured Summary":** Defining the expected content and format of the summary can ensure consistency and completeness.
*   **Confidence Score Granularity:** Defining what factors contribute to a "high" or "low" confidence score would improve the objectivity of this metric.  Also, suggest a scale (e.g., 1-100, Low/Med/High)
*   **Escalation Flag Criteria:** Clarify the conditions under which the escalation flag should be raised.

Stage: Response & Escalation

**## Objectives**
- Maintain evidence alignment and governance compliance.
- Respect orchestration policies while completing assigned actions.
- Thoroughly investigate assigned escalations to determine the appropriate next steps.

**## Policy Context**
- policy.evidence_threshold
- policy.latency_budget
- policy.research_depth
- policy.seed.evidence_threshold
- policy.seed.max_research_depth
- policy.seed.max_total_time

**## Actions (Examples):**
- Review existing alerts and evidence.
- Conduct additional research and analysis to gather further evidence.
- Consult with subject matter experts.
- Document findings and decisions.

**## Required Outputs**
- **Structured Summary of Findings:** A concise summary outlining the key findings of the investigation, including the nature of the issue, potential impact, and relevant supporting details.  This summary should adhere to the standard report template [Link to template/document].
- **Confidence Score (1-100) with Supporting Evidence Identifiers:** A numerical score (1-100) indicating the level of confidence in the findings, based on the strength and corroboration of evidence.  Include a list of identifiers (e.g., alert IDs, log entries, case numbers) for the supporting evidence.  *Example: Low confidence (1-33) - Limited evidence and requires further investigation.  Medium confidence (34-66) - Some supporting evidence but further validation is needed. High confidence (67-100) - Strong, corroborated evidence and action can be taken.*
- **Next-Step Recommendation or Escalation Flag:** A clear recommendation for the next course of action, such as further investigation, remediation, or closure. If the situation meets the escalation criteria (defined below), raise the escalation flag.
- **Escalation Criteria:** An escalation flag should be raised if any of the following criteria are met:
    *   The potential impact is critical (e.g., data breach, system outage).
    *   The situation requires specialized expertise beyond the coordinator's capabilities.
    *   The issue falls outside the scope of existing policies or procedures.
    *   The latency budget is at risk of being exceeded.
    *   [Add other relevant criteria based on your specific context].
