Okay, this is a good high-level overview of the Signal Screener Primary stage within a broader signal screening process. Let's break down each section and consider potential implementations and questions that might arise:

**Stage: Rapid Triage**

*   **Focus:** Emphasizes speed and efficiency in the initial assessment. The goal is to quickly identify promising leads for deeper investigation and discard irrelevant ones. This stage likely handles a high volume of incoming signals.

**Objectives**

*   **Maintain evidence alignment and governance compliance:**
    *   **Implications:**  This requires robust record-keeping, version control, and adherence to predefined data handling policies.  All findings and their supporting evidence must be traceable and auditable.
    *   **Questions:**
        *   How is evidence stored and indexed? (e.g., database, file system, knowledge graph)
        *   What specific compliance regulations are relevant (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, industry-specific standards)?
        *   What mechanisms are in place to ensure data integrity and prevent tampering?
*   **Respect orchestration policies while completing assigned actions:**
    *   **Implications:** The screener operates within a larger automated workflow.  It needs to be aware of its role, dependencies, and constraints defined by the orchestration system.
    *   **Questions:**
        *   What orchestration platform is being used (e.g., Airflow, Prefect, custom system)?
        *   How are actions assigned and tracked?
        *   How are failures handled and retried?
        *   How does the screener communicate its status and results to the orchestration system?

**Policy Context**

This section defines the key policies governing the Rapid Triage stage.  These policies likely define trade-offs between thoroughness, speed, and cost.  Let's analyze each one:

*   **`policy.evidence_threshold`:**  Minimum level of supporting evidence required to trigger further investigation.
    *   **Implications:** This is a crucial parameter for balancing false positives and false negatives. A low threshold will lead to more investigations, while a high threshold might miss valuable signals.
    *   **Questions:**
        *   How is "evidence level" quantified? (e.g., number of independent sources, strength of correlations, expert judgment)
        *   What is the current value of `policy.evidence_threshold`?
        *   Is it a fixed value or dynamically adjusted based on signal characteristics?
*   **`policy.latency_budget`:** Maximum allowable time for completing the triage process for a single signal.
    *   **Implications:**  Directly impacts the speed of the overall pipeline.  Influences the choice of screening techniques and data sources.
    *   **Questions:**
        *   What is the current value of `policy.latency_budget`?
        *   How is latency tracked and monitored?
        *   What happens if the latency budget is exceeded?
*   **`policy.research_depth`:**  Maximum depth of investigation during triage.  This likely limits the number of data sources or the complexity of analyses.
    *   **Implications:** Prevents excessive resource consumption on low-priority signals. Forces the screener to focus on readily available and relevant information.
    *   **Questions:**
        *   How is "research depth" defined? (e.g., number of data sources accessed, number of analysis steps performed)
        *   What specific data sources and analysis techniques are permitted at this stage?
        *   Is there a priority order for accessing data sources?
*   **`policy.seed.evidence_threshold`:**  Evidence threshold specifically for "seed" signals.  Seed signals might be considered higher priority or require different handling.
    *   **Implications:** Allows for more sensitive handling of potentially critical signals.
    *   **Questions:**
        *   What defines a "seed" signal? (e.g., source, type, metadata)
        *   Is the `seed.evidence_threshold` lower or higher than the general `evidence_threshold`? Why?
*   **`policy.seed.max_research_depth`:** Maximum research depth for seed signals.
    *   **Implications:** Ensures a more thorough initial investigation of potential high-impact leads.
    *   **Questions:**
        *   Is the `seed.max_research_depth` greater than the general `research_depth`?
*   **`policy.seed.max_total_time`:** Maximum total time allowed for processing a seed signal.
    *   **Implications:**  Balances the need for thorough investigation with the importance of rapid response.
    *   **Questions:**
        *   Is the `seed.max_total_time` greater than the general implied `latency_budget` for non-seed signals?

**Required Outputs**

*   **Structured summary of findings:**
    *   **Implications:**  The summary should be easily parsable by downstream processes (e.g., other screening stages, human analysts).
    *   **Questions:**
        *   What is the specific data format for the summary (e.g., JSON, XML, CSV)?
        *   What key pieces of information must be included in the summary? (e.g., signal type, key features, relevant entities, potential risks/opportunities)
        *   Are there pre-defined templates for different types of signals?
*   **Confidence score with supporting evidence identifiers:**
    *   **Implications:**  Provides a quantitative measure of the reliability of the findings.  The evidence identifiers allow for easy verification and auditing.
    *   **Questions:**
        *   How is the confidence score calculated? What factors are considered?
        *   What is the range of the confidence score?
        *   How are evidence identifiers represented? (e.g., URLs, database keys, file names)
*   **Next-step recommendation or escalation flag:**
    *   **Implications:**  Drives the orchestration workflow.  Determines whether the signal should be passed to a deeper investigation stage, flagged for human review, or discarded.
    *   **Questions:**
        *   What are the possible next-step recommendations?
        *   Under what conditions should a signal be escalated?
        *   How is the recommendation or escalation flag communicated to the orchestration system?

**Overall Considerations and Next Steps**

This is a solid foundation.  To fully implement this Signal Screener Primary stage, you would need to:

1.  **Define Data Structures:** Precisely define the structure of the input signal, the structured summary of findings, and the evidence identifiers.
2.  **Implement the Scoring Logic:** Develop the algorithm for calculating the confidence score based on the available evidence.
3.  **Implement the Recommendation Logic:** Define the rules for determining the next-step recommendation based on the confidence score, evidence, and signal characteristics.
4.  **Implement Policy Enforcement:** Ensure that the screener adheres to the defined policies regarding evidence threshold, latency budget, and research depth.
5.  **Integrate with Orchestration System:**  Connect the screener to the orchestration system to receive signals, execute actions, and report results.
6.  **Testing and Validation:**  Thoroughly test the screener with a variety of signals to ensure its accuracy, efficiency, and compliance.
7.  **Monitoring and Logging:**  Implement robust monitoring and logging to track performance, identify issues, and ensure data integrity.

By addressing these questions and implementing the necessary logic, you can create a robust and efficient Signal Screener Primary stage for your signal screening pipeline. Remember to document everything thoroughly for maintainability and auditability.
