Okay, I understand. As the Evidence Verifier Primary, operating in the Rapid Analysis stage, my goal is to quickly assess evidence alignment and governance compliance, adhering to the provided policies and respecting orchestration policies.  I will focus on providing structured findings, a confidence score backed by evidence identifiers, and a clear recommendation for the next step, potentially including escalation.

Here's a breakdown of how I will approach this task, keeping the objectives and policy context in mind:

**1. Input Analysis and Prioritization:**

*   Understand the nature of the evidence provided (text, document, image, etc.).
*   Identify the claim or assertion the evidence is intended to support.
*   Prioritize assessment based on the severity of potential policy violations or the impact of inaccurate evidence.

**2. Evidence Verification Process:**

*   **Alignment Check:**  Determine if the evidence is directly relevant to the claim it is intended to support.  I will look for logical connections, direct quotes, data correlations, or other indicators of relevance.  This will be influenced by `policy.evidence_threshold` (how much evidence is needed to consider the claim supported) and `policy.seed.evidence_threshold` (the minimum evidence threshold for seed information).
*   **Governance Compliance:**  Assess whether the evidence is compliant with relevant governance policies (e.g., data privacy, ethical considerations, legal requirements). This might involve identifying Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and checking for appropriate handling procedures, confirming adherence to copyright laws, or checking for potential biases or discriminatory content.
*   **Source Credibility (limited by `policy.research_depth`):**  Depending on the `policy.research_depth`, I will attempt to assess the credibility and reliability of the source of the evidence.  This may involve checking the source's reputation, looking for biases, or comparing the information to other sources.  I will also consider `policy.seed.max_research_depth` for initial seeds.  If research depth is limited, this step will be minimal.
*   **Factuality Check (limited by `policy.research_depth`):**  Again, depending on `policy.research_depth`, I will attempt to verify the factual accuracy of the evidence. This could involve cross-referencing the information with other reliable sources, consulting fact-checking websites, or using specialized knowledge bases. This will be done within the time constraints imposed by `policy.latency_budget` and `policy.seed.max_total_time`.
*   **Risk Assessment:** Assess the risk associated with accepting or rejecting the evidence. This will depend on the context and the potential consequences of an incorrect decision.

**3. Output Generation:**

*   **Structured Summary:** A concise summary outlining the key findings of the evidence verification process, including:
    *   Claim being assessed.
    *   Summary of the evidence.
    *   Assessment of alignment to the claim.
    *   Assessment of governance compliance.
    *   Credibility of the source (if research depth allows).
    *   Factuality of the evidence (if research depth allows).
*   **Confidence Score:** A numerical score (e.g., 0-100) reflecting the confidence in the accuracy and validity of the evidence. This score will be influenced by:
    *   Strength of the alignment.
    *   Level of governance compliance.
    *   Credibility of the source.
    *   Factuality of the evidence.
    *   Availability of corroborating evidence.
*   **Supporting Evidence Identifiers:**  A list of identifiers (e.g., URLs, document IDs, database keys) that support the confidence score and the overall assessment. These identifiers will link to the sources of information used during the verification process.
*   **Next-Step Recommendation:** A clear recommendation for the next action based on the assessment:
    *   **Accept:**  The evidence is considered valid and compliant, and the claim can be accepted.
    *   **Reject:** The evidence is invalid or non-compliant, and the claim should be rejected.
    *   **Further Investigation:**  The evidence is inconclusive or requires further investigation. This may involve:
        *   Requesting additional evidence.
        *   Escalating to a subject matter expert.
        *   Increasing the research depth (if allowed by policy).
    *   **Escalation Flag:** An indicator that the situation requires immediate attention from a higher authority. This could be triggered by:
        *   Potential legal or ethical violations.
        *   High-risk scenarios.
        *   Unresolvable conflicts.

**Example:**

Let's say the claim is: "The Earth is flat." And the evidence is a link to a conspiracy website article arguing for a flat Earth.

Here's how I would likely proceed:

*   **Alignment Check:** The evidence is *somewhat* aligned because it directly addresses the claim, though the direction of alignment is negative.
*   **Governance Compliance:**  No specific governance compliance issues immediately apparent.
*   **Source Credibility:** Very low. The website is known for promoting conspiracy theories and lacks scientific backing.
*   **Factuality Check:**  Extremely low. Overwhelming scientific evidence supports a spherical Earth.
*   **Structured Summary:**  The evidence provided is a link to a conspiracy website arguing that the Earth is flat. The source is highly unreliable, and the claim contradicts overwhelming scientific consensus.
*   **Confidence Score:**  Very low (e.g., 5/100).
*   **Supporting Evidence Identifiers:**  [Link to conspiracy website article], [Links to reputable scientific sources such as NASA, NOAA, etc.].
*   **Next-Step Recommendation:** Reject.
*   **Escalation Flag:** No. The claim, while incorrect, is not inherently harmful or requiring immediate intervention.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Trade-offs:**  Given the "Rapid Analysis" stage, I will need to make trade-offs between thoroughness and speed, balancing the need for a quick assessment with the importance of accuracy.
*   **Policy Prioritization:**  I will prioritize actions based on the potential impact of violating the specified policies. For example, a potential data privacy violation will take precedence over a minor formatting issue.
*   **Iterative Refinement:**  I will continuously refine my process and improve my ability to accurately and efficiently verify evidence based on feedback and experience.

By following this approach, I can effectively function as the Evidence Verifier Primary, ensuring evidence alignment, governance compliance, and timely recommendations, while adhering to the defined policies and objectives.
