This playbook outline describes the responsibilities and constraints for an "Alert Author Primary" during the "Response & Escalation" stage of an incident.  Let's break down each section:

**Stage: Response & Escalation**

This indicates the current phase of the incident lifecycle.  The initial analysis and detection are likely complete, and the focus is now on actively responding to the alert and potentially escalating it to more specialized teams or resources.

**## Objectives**

*   **Maintain evidence alignment and governance compliance:** This is crucial for accountability and potential legal or regulatory scrutiny. The Alert Author must ensure that all actions taken and findings documented are consistent with the available evidence and adhere to established governance policies and procedures. This means:
    *   Documenting all steps taken, decisions made, and evidence reviewed.
    *   Maintaining a clear chain of custody for all artifacts and information.
    *   Following approved procedures for handling sensitive data.
    *   Ensuring compliance with relevant laws, regulations, and internal policies.

*   **Respect orchestration policies while completing assigned actions:** Orchestration policies define automated workflows and procedures for incident response. The Alert Author needs to work within these established guidelines. This likely involves:
    *   Utilizing pre-defined scripts and tools.
    *   Following specific sequences of actions.
    *   Avoiding deviation from approved procedures without explicit authorization.
    *   Contributing to the improvement of orchestration policies based on experience and feedback.

**## Policy Context**

This section highlights the key policies that the Alert Author must consider when executing their tasks.  Understanding these policies is crucial for making informed decisions. Let's break them down:

*   **policy.evidence_threshold:** This defines the minimum amount or quality of evidence required to reach a certain conclusion or take a specific action. The Alert Author must ensure that the evidence they gather meets this threshold before making recommendations or escalating the alert. For example:
    *   High threshold for shutting down a critical system.
    *   Lower threshold for initiating further investigation.

*   **policy.latency_budget:** This sets a time limit for the Alert Author to complete their assigned tasks. It's a critical factor in a fast-moving incident. The Alert Author must prioritize actions and efficiently gather information to meet this deadline. For example:
    *   30 minutes to determine if an alert is a false positive.
    *   2 hours to gather enough evidence to escalate.

*   **policy.research_depth:** This dictates how deeply the Alert Author should investigate the alert.  It balances the need for thoroughness with the urgency of the situation. A shallow research depth might be appropriate for common, low-severity alerts, while a deeper investigation is needed for critical or novel threats.

*   **policy.seed.evidence_threshold:** This specifically refers to the initial evidence provided with the alert, the "seed" evidence. It sets the bar for whether the Alert Author should even proceed with further investigation.  If the initial evidence is too weak, the alert might be dismissed.

*   **policy.seed.max_research_depth:** This limits the amount of research that can be performed based *solely* on the initial "seed" evidence. It likely prevents the Alert Author from going too far down a rabbit hole based on flimsy initial indicators.

*   **policy.seed.max_total_time:**  This specifies the total time that can be spent investigating the alert based on the "seed" evidence. After this time has elapsed, the investigation should be reassessed.

**## Required Outputs**

These are the deliverables that the Alert Author is responsible for producing.

*   **Structured summary of findings:** This should be a concise and organized summary of the Alert Author's investigation, including:
    *   A description of the alert and its potential impact.
    *   A summary of the evidence reviewed.
    *   An analysis of the evidence and its implications.
    *   Any identified anomalies or suspicious activity.
    *   A clear and objective presentation of the findings.

*   **Confidence score with supporting evidence identifiers:** This provides a quantitative assessment of the Alert Author's confidence in their findings. The confidence score should be supported by specific references to the evidence that justifies the rating (e.g., log file ID, network traffic analysis result, vulnerability scan report). For example:
    *   Confidence: 90% based on [Log ID: X123, Network Signature: Y456].

*   **Next-step recommendation or escalation flag:** Based on their findings, the Alert Author must recommend the appropriate next steps. This could include:
    *   Taking specific remediation actions (e.g., isolating an infected system).
    *   Escalating the alert to a more specialized team (e.g., a threat hunting team or incident response team).
    *   Closing the alert as a false positive.
    *   Suggesting further investigation by other teams.
    *   The escalation flag is a clear indication of whether the alert needs to be passed on for further attention.

**In Summary**

The "Alert Author Primary" role in the "Response & Escalation" stage is critical for effectively triaging and responding to security alerts.  They are responsible for gathering and analyzing evidence, making informed decisions based on defined policies, and providing clear recommendations for next steps or escalation. Their work is vital for minimizing the impact of security incidents and ensuring compliance with governance requirements. They are essentially the first responders after an alert has been deemed worthy of attention. They must balance speed and accuracy under the constraints of policies such as latency budget, evidence thresholds, and research depth.
