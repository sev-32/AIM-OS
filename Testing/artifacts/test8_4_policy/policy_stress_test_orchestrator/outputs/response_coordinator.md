This document outlines the responsibilities and objectives of the Response & Escalation Coordinator within the Response Coordination stage, focusing on maintaining alignment with policies related to evidence, latency, research depth, and overall governance.

**Responsibilities:**

*   **Evidence Gathering and Alignment:** Collect and analyze relevant evidence related to the incident, ensuring it aligns with the pre-defined evidence threshold (`policy.evidence_threshold`).
*   **Governance Compliance:**  Ensure all actions and documentation adhere to relevant governance policies and procedures.
*   **Orchestration Policy Adherence:** Execute assigned tasks while adhering to the established orchestration policies for the Response & Escalation stage.  This includes following the defined workflows and using approved tools.
*   **Time Management:**  Work within the defined latency budget (`policy.latency_budget`) for this stage. Prioritize tasks and escalate potential delays proactively.
*   **Research Depth Management:**  Adjust the research depth based on the incident and relevant policies. When starting an investigation (`policy.seed.evidence_threshold`, `policy.seed.max_research_depth`, `policy.seed.max_total_time`):
    *   Use `policy.seed.evidence_threshold` to determine the initial level of required evidence.
    *   Stay within `policy.seed.max_research_depth` for initial investigations.
    *   Don't exceed `policy.seed.max_total_time` for the initial seed investigation.
*   **Structured Reporting:**  Compile a structured summary of findings, clearly articulating the key observations and their significance.
*   **Confidence Scoring:**  Assign a confidence score to the findings, based on the quality and quantity of supporting evidence. Explicitly link the confidence score to the specific evidence identifiers used.
*   **Decision Making:** Based on the findings and confidence score, determine the appropriate next steps, which may include:
    *   Recommending further investigation or action.
    *   Escalating the incident to the next level of response.
*   **Stage Alignment:** Ensure alignment with the previous and subsequent stages of the incident response process (`policy.stage_alignment`).  Provide clear handoffs and documentation to facilitate a smooth transition.

**Deliverables:**

*   **Structured Summary of Findings:** A concise and well-organized document that includes:
    *   Overview of the incident and its potential impact.
    *   Summary of the evidence collected and analyzed.
    *   Key findings and observations.
    *   Analysis of the root cause or contributing factors (if possible).
*   **Confidence Score with Supporting Evidence Identifiers:**  A numerical or qualitative score indicating the confidence level in the findings, accompanied by a list of the evidence identifiers that support the score.  For example:
    *   `Confidence Score: 85%`
    *   `Supporting Evidence Identifiers: Log_File_123, Network_Traffic_Analysis_456, User_Report_789`
*   **Next-Step Recommendation or Escalation Flag:** A clear and actionable recommendation for the next steps to be taken, or a flag indicating that the incident needs to be escalated to a higher level of response. The recommendation should be justified based on the findings and the confidence score. Examples:
    *   `Recommendation: Initiate forensic analysis of affected system.`
    *   `Escalation Flag:  Incident meets criteria for escalation to Incident Commander due to potential data breach (evidence threshold met).`

**Key Skills and Competencies:**

*   Strong analytical and problem-solving skills.
*   Excellent communication and documentation skills.
*   Ability to work under pressure and prioritize tasks.
*   Understanding of incident response processes and procedures.
*   Knowledge of relevant security tools and technologies.
*   Familiarity with compliance requirements and governance policies.

**Example Scenario:**

An alert triggers indicating suspicious network traffic from an internal server. The Response & Escalation Coordinator would:

1.  **Gather Evidence:** Collect relevant logs from the server, network traffic captures, and any relevant user reports.
2.  **Analyze Evidence:** Analyze the logs for malicious activity, the network traffic for unusual patterns, and correlate the data with user reports.
3.  **Assign Confidence Score:**  Based on the evidence, assign a confidence score to the hypothesis that the server has been compromised. (e.g., 90% confidence based on specific log entries and network traffic patterns).
4.  **Document Findings:** Create a structured summary of the findings, including the evidence identifiers and the confidence score.
5.  **Recommend Next Steps:** If the confidence score is high enough to exceed the defined threshold, recommend immediate isolation of the server and a full system scan.  If not, recommend further log analysis and network monitoring.
6.  **Adhere to Policies:** Throughout the process, ensure all actions are compliant with the relevant governance policies, evidence thresholds, and latency budgets.

This document provides a framework for the Response & Escalation Coordinator role.  Specific tasks and responsibilities may vary depending on the organization's policies, procedures, and the nature of the incident. Regular review and updates to this document are recommended to ensure it remains relevant and effective.
