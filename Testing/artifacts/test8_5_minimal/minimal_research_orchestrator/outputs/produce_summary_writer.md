This stage, "Summary Writer Primary," focuses on producing a structured summary of findings while adhering to evidence alignment, governance compliance, and orchestration policies. The primary goal is to condense gathered information into a usable format, assess its reliability, and determine the next course of action. Key outputs include a structured summary, a confidence score with supporting evidence, and a recommendation for the next step, including potential escalation. The process is heavily influenced by pre-defined policies regarding evidence threshold, latency budget, research depth, and seed-related parameters for evidence and research.
