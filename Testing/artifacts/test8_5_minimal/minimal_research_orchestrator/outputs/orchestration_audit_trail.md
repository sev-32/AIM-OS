Okay, I understand the roles of both the Gather Coordinator and the Produce Coordinator. Now, let's define the role of the **Audit Trail Emitter :: Audit Trail Primary** within the **Global Orchestration** stage, building upon the context provided.

**Stage: Global Orchestration** - This implies a high-level process overseeing multiple stages, including "Gather" and "Produce." It's the strategic level where overall policy enforcement, monitoring, and governance take place.

Given the name "Audit Trail Emitter :: Audit Trail Primary," this component is responsible for recording and managing the audit trail for the entire orchestration process. This is critical for governance, compliance, and accountability.

**## Objectives**

*   **Maintain evidence alignment and governance compliance:** This remains a core objective, but at a higher level. The Audit Trail Emitter ensures that the entire orchestration process adheres to all relevant policies and regulations. This includes verifying that the "Gather" and "Produce" stages are operating within their defined constraints and that the final outputs meet the required standards.
*   **Respect orchestration policies while completing assigned actions:** The Audit Trail Emitter must adhere to its own set of policies, primarily those related to data retention, security, and access control for the audit trail itself. This means ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of the audit data.

**## Policy Context**

The Audit Trail Emitter operates under a different (but related) set of policies compared to the Gather and Produce Coordinators. These policies govern the *audit trail itself*, not the specific data being processed.

*   **`policy.evidence_threshold`:** In the context of the Audit Trail Emitter, this likely refers to the required level of detail and completeness in the audit log.  A higher threshold means more granular logging and a more comprehensive record of activity.  A lower threshold may reduce the volume of logs, but at the risk of missing critical information.
    *   **Example:** Setting a higher threshold means logging every API call and data access attempt, while a lower threshold might only log successful high-level operations.
*   **`policy.latency_budget`:**  How quickly audit events must be recorded.  Real-time or near-real-time auditing is often required for immediate threat detection and response.  A lower latency budget is preferable, but can impact system performance.
    *   **Example:** If `policy.latency_budget` is set to "1 second," any event must be recorded within 1 second of its occurrence.  Failing to meet this may trigger an alert or escalation.
*   **`policy.research_depth`:**  While less directly applicable to data collection, this could refer to the depth of analysis performed on the audit logs themselves. Does the system automatically correlate events, perform anomaly detection, or simply record raw data?
    *   **Example:** A "deep" research depth would imply automated analysis and alerting based on patterns in the audit logs, while a "shallow" depth would simply store the logs for later review.
*   **`policy.seed.evidence_threshold`, `policy.seed.max_research_depth`, `policy.seed.max_total_time`:** These seed-related policies are less likely to apply to the Audit Trail Emitter directly. The audit trail captures everything, so there isn't really a concept of "seed" data in the same way. However, these could apply to *initial configuration or setup of the audit system itself.*
*   **`policy.stage_alignment`:**  Ensures that the audit trail includes information relevant to each stage of the orchestration process, allowing for end-to-end traceability. This means knowing what information to collect from the "Gather" and "Produce" stages to provide a complete audit record.
*   **`policy.system_observability`:** Defines what aspects of the system need to be monitored and logged.  This includes resource utilization, performance metrics, and security events. The Audit Trail Emitter is a key component of system observability.
*   **`policy.system_fallbacks`:** Specifies how the system should behave if the audit trail system fails or becomes unavailable. This is crucial for ensuring that critical activities are still logged, even during outages. Possible fallbacks could be:
    *   Buffering events to disk and replaying them when the system is available
    *   Logging to a secondary, redundant system.
*   **`policy.data_retention`:**  Specifies how long audit logs must be stored. This is often dictated by regulatory requirements.
    *   **Example:** PCI DSS requires specific audit logs to be retained for at least one year, with at least three months immediately available for analysis.
*   **`policy.access_control`:**  Defines who has access to the audit logs and what actions they are authorized to perform.  This is crucial for protecting the integrity and confidentiality of the audit data.
    *   **Example:** Only authorized security personnel might be able to view or modify the audit trail configuration.

**## Required Outputs**

*   **Structured summary of findings:**  This is less about presenting findings in the same way as "Gather" or "Produce," and more about *providing the data needed for others to draw conclusions*. The structured summary could be:
    *   A centralized, searchable repository of audit events.
    *   Reports on policy compliance and deviations.
    *   Alerts triggered by anomalous activity in the audit logs.
*   **Confidence score with supporting evidence identifiers:** This is less direct than in the "Gather" or "Produce" stages. The "confidence" might relate to the *integrity and reliability of the audit trail itself*.  For example:
    *   "Audit Log Integrity Confidence: 0.99. Based on successful checksum validation and tamper-detection mechanisms (ID: checksum123, tamper456)." This indicates the system is confident that the audit logs haven't been altered.
    *   The "evidence identifiers" would be the mechanisms used to ensure the integrity of the log, not necessarily evidence supporting a finding.
*   **Next-step recommendation or escalation flag:**  The Audit Trail Emitter should flag issues such as:
    *   **Policy violations:**  If the "Gather" or "Produce" stages are not adhering to policies (e.g., exceeding latency budgets, not meeting evidence thresholds).
    *   **Security threats:**  If the audit logs reveal suspicious activity or potential security breaches.
    *   **System failures:**  If the audit trail system itself is experiencing problems (e.g., disk space exhaustion, performance degradation).  In this case, the "next-step recommendation" would be to address the system issue.

**In Summary:**

The Audit Trail Emitter :: Audit Trail Primary is a critical component of the Global Orchestration stage. It's responsible for ensuring the integrity and availability of the audit trail, monitoring policy compliance, detecting security threats, and providing the data needed for investigation and accountability. It's a passive observer, actively enforcing rules and policies on the whole process. Its success is measured by the completeness, accuracy, and timeliness of the audit data, as well as its ability to detect and alert on potential problems. The specific outputs will be more technical and geared toward compliance monitoring and security analysis, rather than the direct, actionable findings produced by the "Gather" and "Produce" stages.
