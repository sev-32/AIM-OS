Okay, this is a challenging but interesting scenario. We're in the "Retry Manager Primary" stage of a "Global Orchestration" process, and we need to determine how to handle retries based on the context provided from the previous stages: `discovery.coordinator`, `analysis.coordinator`, and `dissemination.coordinator`. The overarching goal is to maintain evidence alignment, governance compliance, and respect orchestration policies, while delivering the required outputs.

Here's how I'll approach this, considering the information from each previous stage:

**1. Understanding the State of the Process:**

First, we need to infer *why* a retry is necessary at this point.  What went wrong in the dissemination stage that triggered the retry?  The inputs don't explicitly say, so we have to consider possible reasons based on what the `dissemination.coordinator` does:

*   **Dissemination Failure (Most Likely):**  The most common reason for a retry is likely a failure during the actual dissemination process. This could be due to:
    *   Technical errors (e.g., system downtime, network issues, API failures).
    *   Stakeholder issues (e.g., incorrect contact information, bouncebacks, delivery failures).
    *   Compliance issues (e.g., the dissemination violated a policy, triggering an automatic rollback).
*   **Quality Issues:** Less likely, but still possible, the findings presented by `dissemination.coordinator` may have been flagged as containing quality issues. This could be triggered by:
     *   A low confidence score on disseminated findings.
     *   A policy violation regarding the evidence base.
     *   Stakeholder feedback indicating inaccuracies.

**2. Triaging the Retry:**

Based on the possible causes, we need to figure out *what* to retry.

*   **If the Retry is due to a Dissemination Failure (Technical):** We likely only need to retry the `dissemination.coordinator`. We will need to provide the same input it received previously.
*   **If the Retry is due to a Compliance Issue:** This is more complex. We need to determine what policy was violated and why. We might need to:
    *   Retry the `dissemination.coordinator` with corrected parameters or stakeholder information.
    *   Escalate the issue if the policy violation originated from an earlier stage.
*   **If the Retry is due to Quality Issues:** We need to consider a broader scope. This might require us to:
    *   Retry the `analysis.coordinator` if the analysis was flawed.
    *   Retry the `discovery.coordinator` if the underlying data was insufficient.

**3.  Respecting the Policy Context (Key for the Retry Manager):**

This is the most important part for the Retry Manager. We MUST consider these policies when deciding *how* to retry:

*   **`policy.evidence_threshold`:** If the disseminated findings were rejected due to insufficient evidence, the Retry Manager needs to ensure that retrying `analysis.coordinator` (and possibly `discovery.coordinator`) leads to a stronger evidence base.  We might need to provide `analysis.coordinator` with a flag indicating to increase the evidence to the required threshold.
*   **`policy.latency_budget`:**  Each retry consumes time. The Retry Manager needs to be aware of the remaining latency budget for the entire orchestration.  If retrying multiple stages will exceed the budget, we need to consider alternative strategies, such as:
    *   Prioritizing the retry of the most likely problem source.
    *   Truncating the retry effort if progress is slow (and potentially escalating).
*   **`policy.research_depth`:** We might need to *increase* the research depth during the retry if the previous attempts failed to produce sufficient evidence. The Retry Manager will need to configure retry attempts with a higher research depth.
*   **`policy.seed.evidence_threshold`, `policy.seed.max_research_depth`, `policy.seed.max_total_time`:** If the issue stems from a problem with the *seed* information used in the initial stages, the Retry Manager may need to:
    *   Invalidate the existing seed and request a new seed.
    *   Relax the `max_research_depth` and `max_total_time` constraints *specifically* for the seed to allow for deeper initial investigation. **Caution:** This must be done carefully to avoid wasting time on unpromising seeds.
*   **`policy.stage_alignment`:** The Retry Manager needs to ensure that any retry effort is aligned with the overall goals of the Global Orchestration.  We shouldn't be pursuing avenues that are tangential or irrelevant to the original objectives.
*   **`policy.system_observability`:** The Retry Manager should leverage system logs and metrics to understand *why* the previous attempt failed. This information will guide the retry strategy.  Effective logging is critical.
*   **`policy.system_fallbacks`:**  If the Retry Manager determines that the primary approach is consistently failing, it should consider using a fallback strategy (if one exists). For example, could a human review the findings if the automated analysis keeps failing?

**4. Developing the Retry Strategy:**

Based on the above analysis, here's a general retry strategy:

1.  **Investigate the Failure (Use Observability):**  Examine system logs, error messages, and audit trails to determine the root cause of the retry request.
2.  **Assess the Scope of the Retry:**
    *   Is it a simple dissemination failure?
    *   Is it a compliance violation?
    *   Is it a quality issue requiring a broader retry?
3.  **Adjust Policies (Carefully):**  If necessary, and *within the limits of pre-defined rules*, adjust policies like `research_depth` or seed constraints for the retry attempt.  Document these adjustments.
4.  **Prioritize and Execute the Retry:**  Retry the appropriate stage(s) in the orchestration, providing the necessary inputs and adjusted policies.
5.  **Monitor the Retry:**  Track the progress of the retry attempt and ensure that it is staying within the latency budget.
6.  **Escalate if Necessary:**  If the retry continues to fail or exceeds the latency budget, escalate the issue to a higher authority.

**5. Required Outputs (for the Retry Manager):**

*   **Structured Summary of Findings:**  A summary of the retry *strategy* used, the stages retried, any policy adjustments made, and the result of the retry attempt. This is crucial for auditing.
*   **Confidence Score with Supporting Evidence Identifiers:**  The confidence score should reflect the Retry Manager's confidence in the retry strategy itself.  The evidence identifiers would refer to log files, audit trails, and the specific policy adjustments made.  For example: "Retry Strategy Confidence: 90%.  Evidence: Log file X, Audit Trail Y, Policy Adjustment Z."
*   **Next-Step Recommendation or Escalation Flag:**
    *   **Next-Step Recommendation:**  If the retry was successful, recommend proceeding to the next stage of the Global Orchestration.
    *   **Escalation Flag:** If the retry failed, or if the latency budget is in jeopardy, escalate the issue to a higher authority.

**Example Scenario:**

Let's say the dissemination failed because a stakeholder's email address was incorrect (a technical dissemination failure).

*   **Investigation:** Logs show a bounceback with "user unknown."
*   **Scope:**  Retry only `dissemination.coordinator` with the corrected email address.
*   **Policy Adjustment:** No policy adjustments are necessary.
*   **Retry Execution:**  Retry `dissemination.coordinator` with corrected email.
*   **Output:**
    *   Structured Summary: "Retry of dissemination stage due to incorrect email address. Email address corrected and dissemination re-attempted successfully."
    *   Confidence Score: "100%.  Evidence: Dissemination logs showing successful delivery to corrected email address."
    *   Next-Step: "Proceed to next stage of Global Orchestration."

**Key Considerations for the Retry Manager Role:**

*   **Deep Understanding of Orchestration:**  You need a comprehensive understanding of the entire Global Orchestration process, including the roles of each stage and the dependencies between them.
*   **Policy Expertise:**  You must be an expert on the policies that govern the orchestration.
*   **Troubleshooting Skills:**  You need strong troubleshooting skills to identify the root cause of retry requests.
*   **Decision-Making Under Pressure:**  You need to be able to make quick, informed decisions under time pressure.
*   **Communication Skills:**  You need to be able to clearly communicate the retry strategy and the results of the retry attempt to stakeholders.

By following this approach, the Retry Manager can effectively manage retries while maintaining evidence alignment, governance compliance, and respecting orchestration policies. Remember that the key is to understand *why* the retry is necessary and to adjust the retry strategy accordingly.
