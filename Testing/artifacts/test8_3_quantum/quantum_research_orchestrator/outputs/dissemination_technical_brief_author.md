Okay, this is a good starting point for a technical brief author role. Let's break down each section and then think about how we can improve it.

**Analysis of Current Structure**

*   **Title:** "Technical Brief Author :: Technical Brief Author Primary" - This is redundant.  It should be simplified to just "Technical Brief Author".  We might consider adding a sub-descriptor, like "Technical Brief Author - Research Focus" or "Technical Brief Author - Synthesis Focus" if roles are specialized.
*   **Stage: Stakeholder Dissemination** - This is helpful context. It immediately tells the author *where* their work fits in the overall process.
*   **Objectives:**  Clear and concise. The connection to policy is good.
*   **Policy Context:** This is *critical*.  Explicitly stating the relevant policies ensures the author understands the constraints and guidelines.
*   **Required Outputs:** Well-defined.  The combination of summary, confidence score, and a next-step recommendation is exactly what's needed.

**Suggestions for Improvement & Expansion**

Here's how we can build upon this to create a more robust and useful document:

**1. Refine the Title:**

*   **Revised:** "Technical Brief Author" (Sufficient for most cases)
*   **Alternative:** "Technical Brief Author - Synthesis and Recommendation" (If the role is specifically focused on the final steps)

**2. Add a "Purpose" Section:**

*   This clarifies *why* the Technical Brief Author role exists within the broader process.
*   **Example:** "Purpose: To synthesize research findings and available evidence into a concise and actionable technical brief for stakeholder review, ensuring alignment with organizational policies and objectives."

**3. Expand on Objectives with Measurable Key Results (KR):**

*   Turn the Objectives into SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals.
*   **Example (Objective 1: Maintain evidence alignment and governance compliance):**
    *   **KR1:** Technical briefs demonstrate 100% traceability of claims to supporting evidence identifiers.
    *   **KR2:** Technical briefs adhere to all relevant policy requirements, as evidenced by [Compliance Audit Metrics].
*   **Example (Objective 2: Respect orchestration policies while completing assigned actions):**
    *   **KR1:** Average completion time per technical brief remains within the policy.latency_budget.
    *   **KR2:** Documentation of research processes aligns with policy.research_depth requirements.

**4. Elaborate on "Policy Context" with Examples and Guidance:**

*   While listing the policies is good, provide a brief explanation of what each policy *means* for the author.
*   **Example:**
    *   **policy.evidence_threshold:** "Technical briefs must only include claims that meet the minimum threshold of evidence strength defined in this policy (e.g., based on p-value, effect size, sample size).  Refer to [link to evidence threshold guideline] for specific criteria."
    *   **policy.latency_budget:** "This policy limits the time allocated to producing a technical brief.  Prioritize research and analysis based on potential impact and relevance.  Escalate if the required research exceeds the allocated time."
    *   **policy.research_depth:** "This policy dictates the level of detail required in the research process. Refer to research depth matrix to ensure adherence to requirements."
    *   **policy.seed.evidence_threshold:** "During initial research, evidence must meet the stated evidence threshold before proceeding."
    *   **policy.seed.max_research_depth:** "Initial seed research is limited to this depth to identify relevant avenues of investigation."
    *   **policy.seed.max_total_time:** "The initial seed research phase cannot exceed the stated time to promote timely delivery of the finished product."

**5.  Add Details to "Required Outputs":**

*   Be more specific about the format, length, and target audience of the summary.
*   Provide examples of how to calculate the confidence score.  What factors should be considered?
*   Clarify the criteria for "escalation."
*   **Example:**
    *   **Structured summary of findings:** "A concise (1-2 page) document summarizing key research findings, formatted according to the [Technical Brief Template] and targeted at [Stakeholder Group].  Focus on actionable insights and implications."
    *   **Confidence score with supporting evidence identifiers:** "A numerical score (e.g., 1-10) reflecting the overall confidence in the findings, based on the quality and quantity of supporting evidence.  Include a list of evidence identifiers (e.g., DOI, internal document ID) for each claim."  (Include example calculation method)
    *   **Next-step recommendation or escalation flag:** "Provide a clear recommendation for next steps (e.g., further investigation, stakeholder review, implementation).  Escalate to [Escalation Point - e.g., Research Lead] if findings are inconclusive, contradict existing policy, or require further expert analysis."

**6. Add a "Skills/Competencies" Section (Optional):**

*   If certain skills are crucial for the role, list them here.
*   **Example:**
    *   Strong research and analytical skills
    *   Excellent written communication skills
    *   Ability to synthesize complex information
    *   Familiarity with [Specific Research Databases/Tools]
    *   Understanding of relevant policy and regulatory frameworks

**7.  Add a "Workflow Integration" or "Inputs/Outputs" Section (Optional):**

*   This helps the author understand how their work connects to other roles and processes.
*   **Example:**
    *   **Inputs:**  Research reports, data analysis, expert opinions, policy documents.
    *   **Outputs:**  Technical brief, confidence score, recommendation for next steps.
    *   **Dependencies:** Completion of research phase by [Researcher Role].  Review of technical brief by [Stakeholder Role].

**Revised Example Document (incorporating suggestions):**

# Technical Brief Author

Stage: Stakeholder Dissemination

**Purpose:** To synthesize research findings and available evidence into a concise and actionable technical brief for stakeholder review, ensuring alignment with organizational policies and objectives.

## Objectives

*   Maintain evidence alignment and governance compliance.
    *   **KR1:** Technical briefs demonstrate 100% traceability of claims to supporting evidence identifiers.
    *   **KR2:** Technical briefs adhere to all relevant policy requirements, as evidenced by [Compliance Audit Metrics].
*   Respect orchestration policies while completing assigned actions.
    *   **KR1:** Average completion time per technical brief remains within the policy.latency_budget.
