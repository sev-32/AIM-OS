Okay, this outlines the role of a Stakeholder Dissemination Coordinator within a "Dissemination Coordination" process. Let's break down the key aspects and consider what this role entails:

**Overall Goal:** To ensure information is disseminated to stakeholders in a well-governed, compliant, and effective manner.  The focus is on evidence-based findings and ensuring those findings are presented with appropriate confidence and next steps.

**Breakdown of Sections:**

*   **Stage: Stakeholder Dissemination:** This clarifies that the coordinator operates within the final stage of a broader dissemination process. This suggests that the research, analysis, and potentially solution development have already occurred. The coordinator's job is to share the results (findings) with relevant stakeholders.

*   **Objectives:**
    *   **Maintain evidence alignment and governance compliance:**  This is crucial. The coordinator needs to ensure that all disseminated information is:
        *   **Evidence-aligned:**  Based on the underlying research and analysis, accurately reflecting the findings and supporting conclusions.  No exaggerations, misinterpretations, or unsupported claims.
        *   **Governance compliant:**  Adhering to all relevant policies, regulations, and internal guidelines related to data privacy, security, and ethical dissemination practices.  This could involve legal reviews, approvals from compliance departments, and adherence to communication protocols.
    *   **Respect orchestration policies while completing assigned actions:**  This implies that the dissemination process is likely automated or guided by a workflow (an "orchestration").  The coordinator must understand and follow the rules of this workflow, ensuring tasks are completed correctly and within specified timelines.

*   **Policy Context:** This is where the details matter. Each policy influences how the coordinator approaches their work. Understanding these policies is critical.
    *   **`policy.evidence_threshold`:**  Specifies the minimum amount and quality of evidence required to support a finding before it can be disseminated. The coordinator needs to be able to assess whether the evidence meets this threshold.
    *   **`policy.latency_budget`:** Defines the maximum time allowed for disseminating information to stakeholders. This means the coordinator must work efficiently and prioritize tasks to meet deadlines.
    *   **`policy.research_depth`:**  Determines how deeply the coordinator needs to delve into the underlying research to understand the findings and their implications.  This might influence the level of detail included in the structured summary.
    *   **`policy.seed.evidence_threshold`, `policy.seed.max_research_depth`, `policy.seed.max_total_time`:** These seem related to an initial "seed" finding or idea.  They likely govern the initial exploration of an idea before it's escalated to full dissemination. The coordinator needs to understand how these policies influence the initial findings they're working with.
    *   **`policy.stage_alignment`:**  Ensures that the dissemination activities are aligned with the goals and requirements of the "Stakeholder Dissemination" stage.  This means the coordinator shouldn't be performing tasks that belong to a different stage of the process.

*   **Required Outputs:**
    *   **Structured summary of findings:**  A clear, concise, and well-organized summary of the key findings, tailored for the intended stakeholders. This summary should highlight the implications of the findings and answer the questions stakeholders are most likely to have.  Consider using a specific template or format for consistency.
    *   **Confidence score with supporting evidence identifiers:**  A quantitative or qualitative measure of the certainty associated with the findings, along with specific references (identifiers) to the evidence that supports that confidence level.  This allows stakeholders to assess the reliability of the information.
    *   **Next-step recommendation or escalation flag:**  Based on the findings and their confidence level, the coordinator must recommend the next logical step (e.g., further research, implementation of a solution, communication to a wider audience) or flag the issue for escalation if there are concerns or uncertainties that need higher-level attention.

**Key Responsibilities (Inferred):**

*   **Evidence Review:**  Thoroughly examine the underlying research and evidence to understand the findings and their limitations.
*   **Policy Interpretation:**  Understand and apply the various policies outlined in the "Policy Context."
*   **Stakeholder Understanding:**  Identify the target stakeholders and tailor the dissemination materials to their specific needs and level of understanding.
*   **Summary Creation:**  Develop clear and concise structured summaries of the findings.
*   **Confidence Assessment:**  Accurately assess the confidence level of the findings based on the available evidence.
*   **Communication:**  Effectively communicate the findings to stakeholders in a timely and professional manner.
*   **Risk Management:**  Identify potential risks associated with the dissemination of information and take steps to mitigate those risks.
*   **Workflow Management:**  Follow the established workflow and processes for dissemination.
*   **Escalation:**  Escalate issues or concerns to the appropriate personnel when necessary.
*   **Documentation:**  Maintain records of all dissemination activities and decisions.

**Questions to ask for clarification:**

*   What specific tools or templates are used for creating structured summaries?
*   How is the confidence score calculated and what are the acceptable ranges?
*   What is the process for identifying and documenting supporting evidence identifiers?
*   What are the criteria for escalating an issue?
*   Who are the primary stakeholders for this role?
*   What are the expected timelines for disseminating information to different stakeholder groups?
*   What are the specific governance and compliance requirements that apply to this role?
*   What are the consequences of violating the policies outlined in the "Policy Context"?
*   Are there examples of past dissemination activities that I can review?

This detailed analysis provides a strong understanding of the Stakeholder Dissemination Coordinator role and the important responsibilities it entails. The key is to understand the policies, the stakeholders, and how to effectively communicate evidence-based findings with the appropriate level of confidence.
