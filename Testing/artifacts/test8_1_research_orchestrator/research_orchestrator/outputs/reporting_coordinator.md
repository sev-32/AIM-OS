This outlines the responsibilities and context for a Reporting Coordinator within a reporting stage. Let's break it down further:

**Core Responsibilities:**

*   **Maintain Evidence Alignment and Governance Compliance:** This is the *primary* objective. The Coordinator needs to ensure all collected and analyzed evidence is relevant, accurate, and supports the overall reporting goals. This includes adhering to internal governance policies, industry regulations, and any legal requirements.  Key questions to consider:
    *   Does the evidence actually support the findings?
    *   Is the evidence gathered ethically and legally?
    *   Is the evidence properly documented and auditable?
    *   Does the evidence meet the organization's standards for quality and reliability?
*   **Respect Orchestration Policies while Completing Assigned Actions:**  This means working within the defined workflows, processes, and established guidelines for the reporting stage. The Coordinator doesn't have free reign to deviate significantly from the prescribed methods. This ensures consistency, efficiency, and avoids introducing unnecessary risks.  This also likely means working with other roles or departments seamlessly.

**Detailed Explanation of Policy Context:**

The "Policy Context" section highlights specific organizational policies that directly impact the Reporting Coordinator's work.  Understanding these policies is *crucial* for effective performance. Let's analyze each:

*   **`policy.evidence_threshold`:**  This likely defines the minimum amount or quality of evidence required before a finding can be considered valid and included in the report. A high threshold requires more robust and convincing evidence, while a low threshold might allow for preliminary findings based on limited information.  The Coordinator needs to know *how much* evidence is enough.
*   **`policy.latency_budget`:**  This dictates the allowed time for the entire reporting process or specific tasks within the reporting stage. The Coordinator must be aware of deadlines and prioritize tasks accordingly. They might need to escalate issues or flag potential delays if timelines are threatened. Time management and efficiency are key here.
*   **`policy.research_depth`:** This policy controls how deeply the Coordinator (or supporting researchers) must investigate a particular area or claim. A shallow research depth might involve a quick overview of readily available information, while a deep research depth requires extensive investigation, data analysis, and potentially primary research.
*   **`policy.seed.evidence_threshold`:** This refers to the minimum amount of evidence required to *start* an investigation based on an initial "seed" (a starting point or hypothesis).  If the initial evidence is too weak, the investigation might not be justified.
*   **`policy.seed.max_research_depth`:** This limits the depth of investigation that can be conducted based solely on the initial "seed" information.  It prevents spending excessive resources on a line of inquiry that may ultimately prove fruitless.
*   **`policy.seed.max_total_time`:**  This is the maximum allowed time to investigate a "seed" hypothesis.  Similar to `seed.max_research_depth`, it puts a limit on resource consumption for potentially low-value leads.
*   **`policy.stage_alignment`:**  This ensures consistency and coordination between different stages of the overall process. The Coordinator must ensure that their work aligns with the objectives and requirements of the preceding and subsequent stages.  This promotes a smooth and integrated workflow.

**Analysis of Required Outputs:**

The outputs provide a clear picture of the Coordinator's deliverables.

*   **Structured summary of findings:**  This is the primary output. The summary should be well-organized, concise, and easily understandable by stakeholders. It should highlight the key findings supported by the evidence. This likely involves following a pre-defined template or format.
*   **Confidence score with supporting evidence identifiers:** This is crucial for transparency and accountability. The confidence score reflects the Coordinator's assessment of the reliability and validity of the findings, based on the strength of the supporting evidence. The evidence identifiers (e.g., document names, database IDs, URLS) allow reviewers to easily trace the findings back to their source. This helps validate the conclusions.
*   **Next-step recommendation or escalation flag:** The Coordinator is not just reporting findings, but also providing guidance. A next-step recommendation suggests what actions should be taken based on the findings (e.g., further investigation, policy changes, remediation efforts). An escalation flag indicates that the issue requires attention from a higher authority due to its severity, complexity, or potential impact.  This output demonstrates proactive problem-solving.

**In Summary:**

The Reporting Coordinator is a critical role focused on ensuring the accuracy, reliability, and completeness of reporting. They are responsible for adhering to organizational policies, managing timelines, and providing actionable insights based on the evidence. Their work is crucial for informed decision-making and maintaining regulatory compliance. The role requires strong analytical skills, attention to detail, and a thorough understanding of the relevant policies and procedures. They are not just collecting data, but synthesizing it into a coherent and defensible narrative.
