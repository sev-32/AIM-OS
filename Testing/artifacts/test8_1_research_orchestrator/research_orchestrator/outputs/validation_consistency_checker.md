## Consistency Checker - Primary: Validation Stage Details

This document outlines the detailed functionality and requirements for the Consistency Checker - Primary stage within the validation process.  This stage focuses on ensuring alignment of evidence, adherence to governance policies, and respect for orchestration policies while performing its assigned actions.

**1. Detailed Objectives:**

*   **Maintain Evidence Alignment and Governance Compliance:**
    *   **Evidence Alignment:** Verify that the collected evidence supports the claims, assertions, or findings being validated. This includes checking for logical consistency, completeness, and relevance of evidence to the subject matter.  Any contradictory or missing evidence must be flagged.
    *   **Governance Compliance:** Ensure that the validation process adheres to pre-defined governance policies, including but not limited to data privacy regulations, security protocols, and organizational standards.
*   **Respect Orchestration Policies:**
    *   **Latency Budget:** Complete all assigned actions within the allocated latency budget (defined in `policy.latency_budget`).  Alerts should be triggered if the process is likely to exceed the budget.
    *   **Complete Assigned Actions:** Execute all steps in the prescribed workflow, addressing all aspects of consistency checking.

**2. Input Requirements:**

*   **Evidence Collection:** This stage requires access to the collected evidence package, including documents, logs, data sets, and any other relevant artifacts.  The evidence should be accessible and structured for automated analysis.
*   **Validation Scope:** Clearly defined scope of validation including specific claims, assertions, or findings to be validated.
*   **Policy Definitions:** Access to the relevant policy definitions listed in the "Policy Context" section.  These definitions are crucial for guiding the validation process.
*   **Metadata:** Associated metadata regarding the evidence source, collection method, and trustworthiness score (if available).

**3. Process Steps:**

1.  **Evidence Parsing & Indexing:**
    *   Parse and index the collected evidence to enable efficient searching and analysis.
    *   Extract key entities, relationships, and metadata from the evidence.
2.  **Claim/Assertion Verification:**
    *   Based on the validation scope, identify the claims or assertions that need to be validated.
    *   For each claim/assertion:
        *   Search the indexed evidence for supporting and contradicting information.
        *   Assess the strength of supporting and contradicting evidence based on source reliability, relevance, and completeness.
        *   Calculate a preliminary confidence score based on the balance of supporting and contradicting evidence, considering `policy.evidence_threshold` (minimum evidence required for confidence).
3.  **Governance Policy Check:**
    *   Verify that the evidence collection and validation process complies with all applicable governance policies (data privacy, security, etc.).
    *   Check for any violations of governance policies based on the evidence content or handling procedures.
    *   Document any observed policy violations.
4.  **Orchestration Policy Monitoring:**
    *   Monitor the time spent on each step of the validation process to ensure adherence to the `policy.latency_budget`.
    *   Track resource consumption and identify potential bottlenecks.
    *   Alert if the process is likely to exceed the allocated latency budget.
5.  **Research Depth Adjustment (if applicable):**
    *   If the initial evidence analysis yields insufficient confidence, adjust the `policy.research_depth` (if permitted by orchestration policies) to broaden the search and analysis scope.  This might involve accessing additional data sources or employing more sophisticated analysis techniques.  Ensure the research depth doesn't exceed `policy.seed.max_research_depth` if validating a seed claim/assertion.
6.  **Seed Claim Validation (if applicable):**
    *   If validating a seed claim, adhere to the specific constraints on evidence threshold (`policy.seed.evidence_threshold`), maximum research depth (`policy.seed.max_research_depth`), and maximum total time (`policy.seed.max_total_time`).
7.  **Confidence Score Calculation & Reporting:**
    *   Calculate a final confidence score based on the totality of evidence, considering the strength and reliability of supporting and contradicting information, as well as the adherence to governance policies.
    *   Generate a structured summary of findings, including the claims/assertions validated, the supporting and contradicting evidence, the calculated confidence score, and any observed policy violations.

**4. Required Outputs:**

*   **Structured Summary of Findings:**
    *   A clear and concise summary of the validation results, including:
        *   Claim/Assertion ID
        *   Validation Result (Supported, Contradicted, Inconclusive)
        *   List of supporting evidence identifiers with descriptions of their relevance and reliability.
        *   List of contradicting evidence identifiers with descriptions of their relevance and reliability.
        *   Observed policy violations (if any).
        *   Justification for the calculated confidence score.
*   **Confidence Score with Supporting Evidence Identifiers:**
    *   A numerical confidence score (e.g., 0-100) representing the level of confidence in the validation result.
    *   A list of evidence identifiers that directly support the assigned confidence score.  The identifiers should be linked to the specific evidence sources.
*   **Next-Step Recommendation or Escalation Flag:**
    *   Based on the validation results and confidence score, provide a clear recommendation for the next step:
        *   **Acceptance:** If the confidence score is high and the evidence supports the claim/assertion.
        *   **Further Investigation:** If the confidence score is moderate or the evidence is inconclusive. This may involve requesting additional evidence or performing more in-depth analysis.
        *   **Rejection:** If the confidence score is low and the evidence contradicts the claim/assertion.
        *   **Escalation Flag:** If any serious policy violations or critical inconsistencies are detected, flag the case for escalation to a human reviewer.  Also escalate if the seed policy constraints are violated.

**5. Performance Metrics:**

*   **Accuracy:** The degree to which the validation results accurately reflect the true state of the evidence.
*   **Completion Rate:** The percentage of claims/assertions that are successfully validated.
*   **Latency:** The time required to complete the validation process.
*   **Resource Consumption:** The amount of computing resources (CPU, memory, storage) consumed during the validation process.
*   **Policy Compliance Rate:** The percentage of validation processes that comply with all applicable governance policies.
*   **Escalation Rate:** The percentage of cases that are flagged for escalation to a human reviewer.

**6. Error Handling:**

*   Implement robust error handling mechanisms to handle unexpected errors or exceptions during the validation process.
*   Log all errors and exceptions to facilitate debugging and troubleshooting.
*   Provide informative error messages to users and administrators.
*   Attempt to recover from errors gracefully and continue the validation process whenever possible.

**7. Security Considerations:**

*   Ensure that all data access and processing operations are performed securely.
*   Protect sensitive data from unauthorized access or disclosure.
*   Implement appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms.
*   Regularly audit and review security controls.

**8. Future Enhancements:**

*   Implement machine learning models to automate the evidence analysis and confidence score calculation process.
*   Develop a more sophisticated mechanism for adjusting the research depth based on the characteristics of the claim/assertion and the available evidence.
*   Integrate with external threat intelligence feeds to enhance the detection of policy violations.

This detailed outline provides a comprehensive understanding of the Consistency Checker - Primary stage within the validation process. By adhering to these guidelines, we can ensure the accuracy, efficiency, and reliability of the validation process.
