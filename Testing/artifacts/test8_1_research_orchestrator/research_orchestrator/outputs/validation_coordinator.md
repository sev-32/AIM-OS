This document outlines the responsibilities and expectations for a Validation Coordinator, focusing on Validation Coordination within a larger process. Here's a breakdown of the elements and their implications:

**Role:** Validation Coordinator

**Stage:** Validation

**Overall Goal:** Ensure the validation process is robust, compliant, and efficient. The Coordinator is the linchpin connecting evidence, policy, and actionable outcomes.

**Responsibilities/Objectives (Explained):**

*   **Maintain evidence alignment and governance compliance:**  This is the core responsibility. The Validation Coordinator must ensure that all evidence gathered and reviewed directly supports the validation effort and adheres to relevant governance policies. This includes things like:
    *   **Traceability:** Maintaining a clear chain of custody and origin for all evidence.
    *   **Completeness:** Ensuring all necessary evidence is present and accounted for.
    *   **Accuracy:** Verifying the validity and reliability of the evidence.
    *   **Compliance:**  Adhering to internal policies, external regulations, and industry standards.
*   **Respect orchestration policies while completing assigned actions:** The validation process likely exists within a larger workflow or orchestration. The Coordinator needs to:
    *   Understand the overall workflow.
    *   Follow established procedures and guidelines for their specific role.
    *   Coordinate effectively with other roles and stages.
    *   Avoid creating bottlenecks or delays.

**Policy Context (Explained):**

These policies provide the framework and constraints within which the Validation Coordinator operates. Understanding these is crucial for making informed decisions.

*   **`policy.evidence_threshold`:**  The minimum amount or quality of evidence required to reach a valid conclusion.  This dictates how much research and investigation is necessary.  A higher threshold means more rigorous validation is needed.
*   **`policy.latency_budget`:**  The maximum allowable time for the validation process. The Coordinator needs to balance thoroughness with speed, ensuring validation is completed within the allotted timeframe. This might require prioritizing evidence or using time-saving techniques.
*   **`policy.research_depth`:**  The extent to which the Coordinator is expected to investigate the evidence.  This could range from a surface-level review to a deep dive involving detailed analysis and cross-referencing.
*   **`policy.seed.evidence_threshold`:** If this validation is "seeded" by a preliminary finding (seed), this is the minimum threshold needed to continue validation. If the initial seed evidence doesn't meet this threshold, validation may be stopped or redirected.
*   **`policy.seed.max_research_depth`:** If a validation is "seeded" by a preliminary finding (seed), this is the maximum research depth allowed related to validating just that seed.
*   **`policy.seed.max_total_time`:** If a validation is "seeded" by a preliminary finding (seed), this is the maximum total time allowed related to validating just that seed.
*   **`policy.stage_alignment`:**  This outlines how the validation stage must align with other stages in the overall process.  This ensures consistency and compatibility between different parts of the workflow.  For example, it might define the required format of evidence passed to the validation stage or the acceptable format of the outputs from the validation stage.

**Required Outputs (Explained):**

These are the tangible deliverables that demonstrate the Coordinator's work.

*   **Structured summary of findings:**  A concise and organized report of the validation results. This should include key observations, analyses, and conclusions.  The structure likely follows a predefined template to ensure consistency.
*   **Confidence score with supporting evidence identifiers:**  A numerical rating reflecting the certainty of the findings, along with references to the specific evidence used to support that rating. This provides transparency and allows others to assess the validity of the conclusion.  Higher confidence scores usually require stronger and more abundant evidence.
*   **Next-step recommendation or escalation flag:**  Based on the findings, the Coordinator must recommend the appropriate next course of action. This could include:
    *   **Next-step recommendation:** Proceeding to the next stage in the process, gathering additional evidence, or refining the validation criteria.
    *   **Escalation flag:**  Alerting a higher authority or subject matter expert when issues are encountered that require specialized knowledge or decision-making.  This could be triggered by conflicting evidence, unresolved uncertainties, or potential policy violations.

**In summary, the Validation Coordinator is a critical role responsible for ensuring the validity, compliance, and efficiency of the validation process. They must be detail-oriented, possess strong analytical skills, and have a deep understanding of the relevant policies and procedures.**

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine a Validation Coordinator tasked with validating a claim about a new security vulnerability.

*   **Policy Context:** `policy.evidence_threshold` is set to "High" requiring multiple independent sources confirming the vulnerability. `policy.latency_budget` is 24 hours due to the potential severity of the vulnerability. `policy.research_depth` is "Comprehensive," requiring thorough investigation of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
*   **Coordinator's Actions:**
    *   Gathers evidence from reputable security blogs, vendor advisories, and vulnerability databases.
    *   Analyzes the evidence to determine the severity and exploitability of the vulnerability.
    *   Calculates a confidence score based on the number and quality of the supporting sources.
    *   If the evidence threshold is met and the confidence score is high, the Coordinator recommends escalating the vulnerability to the security incident response team for immediate action. If the evidence is insufficient or the confidence score is low, the Coordinator recommends further investigation.
*   **Required Outputs:**
    *   A structured summary detailing the vulnerability, its potential impact, and the supporting evidence.
    *   A confidence score (e.g., 95%) with references to the specific evidence (e.g., CVE-2023-1234, vendor advisory XYZ).
    *   A recommendation to escalate the vulnerability to the security incident response team.
