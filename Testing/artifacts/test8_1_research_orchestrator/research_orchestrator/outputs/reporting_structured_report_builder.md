Okay, this is a good starting point for outlining the responsibilities of a "Structured Report Builder Primary" agent within a larger system.  Let's break down each section and consider ways to make it even more concrete and useful:

**1. Stage: Reporting**

*   **Importance:** This clarifies the role's position in the overall process. Reporting is the *culmination* of some other processing. It implies prior activities like data collection, analysis, or investigation.

**2. Objectives**

*   **Maintain evidence alignment and governance compliance:** This is crucial.  It highlights the need for traceability and accountability.  Let's add some potential actions:
    *   **Actions:**
        *   Verify evidence relevance and validity.
        *   Ensure all included evidence is properly cited and attributed.
        *   Adhere to data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA).
        *   Document the provenance of each piece of evidence.
*   **Respect orchestration policies while completing assigned actions:** This emphasizes that the agent is part of a larger automated workflow.  Let's make it more specific:
    *   **Actions:**
        *   Prioritize tasks based on urgency and impact as defined by the orchestration policy.
        *   Utilize pre-defined APIs and tools for data retrieval and analysis.
        *   Log all actions and decisions for auditing purposes.
        *   Signal completion or failure of tasks to the orchestration system.
        *   Handle interruptions and re-prioritization gracefully (e.g., if `policy.latency_budget` is about to be breached).

**3. Policy Context**

This is the core of how the agent's behavior is governed. Let's analyze each policy and how it might influence actions:

*   **`policy.evidence_threshold`:**  Minimum confidence level required for evidence to be included in the report.
    *   **Example:**  If `policy.evidence_threshold = 0.8`, only evidence with a confidence score of 80% or higher should be included in the report.
    *   **Actions:**
        *   Filter evidence based on the `policy.evidence_threshold`.
        *   Request additional evidence if the threshold cannot be met with existing data.
        *   Document any instances where the threshold cannot be met and the reasons why.
*   **`policy.latency_budget`:**  Maximum time allowed to generate the report.
    *   **Example:**  If `policy.latency_budget = 60`, the report must be generated within 60 seconds.
    *   **Actions:**
        *   Prioritize faster evidence retrieval and analysis methods.
        *   Implement caching mechanisms to reduce redundant computations.
        *   Truncate research depth if necessary to meet the deadline (potentially lowering the confidence score, but noting the trade-off).
        *   Signal to the orchestration system if the `latency_budget` is likely to be exceeded.
*   **`policy.research_depth`:**  The extent to which the agent should investigate the evidence.
    *   **Example:** `policy.research_depth = 2` might mean following two levels of evidence links or relationships.
    *   **Actions:**
        *   Control the number of iterations or levels of analysis performed on the evidence.
        *   Balance research depth with the `latency_budget`.
        *   Document the level of research depth achieved.
*   **`policy.seed.evidence_threshold`:** The minimum confidence level for the initial "seed" evidence (the starting point).
    *   **Example:** `policy.seed.evidence_threshold = 0.95`
    *   **Actions:**
        *  Validate the quality of the initial information that the agent is acting on, ensuring that any subsequent actions are based on high quality and trusted data.
        *   Return an error if the seed evidence threshold cannot be met.
*   **`policy.seed.max_research_depth`:** The max depth allowed from the seed evidence.
    *   **Example:** `policy.seed.max_research_depth = 5`
*   **`policy.seed.max_total_time`:** The maximum amount of time dedicated to processing the initial seed.
    *   **Example:** `policy.seed.max_total_time = 10`

**4. Required Outputs**

*   **Structured summary of findings:** This needs to be more precise.  What format?  What content?
    *   **Specification:**
        *   **Format:**  JSON, Markdown, or a specific schema (e.g., a pre-defined report template).
        *   **Content:**
            *   Executive summary (brief overview of key findings).
            *   Detailed analysis of each finding.
            *   Supporting evidence for each finding.
            *   Identified patterns and anomalies.
            *   Potential risks and opportunities.
            *   Conclusion.
            *   All outputs will also be logged to a specified vector store for auditing purposes and future use.
*   **Confidence score with supporting evidence identifiers:**  Critical for auditability and reliability.
    *   **Specification:**
        *   Overall confidence score for the entire report.
        *   Confidence score for each individual finding.
        *   List of evidence identifiers (e.g., URLs, database IDs, document hashes) that support each finding.
        *   Mechanism for tracing the lineage of evidence back to its source.
*   **Next-step recommendation or escalation flag:**  Actionable intelligence is key.
    *   **Specification:**
        *   **Recommendation:** Suggest the next logical action based on the findings (e.g., "Investigate further," "Implement mitigation strategy," "Inform relevant stakeholders").
        *   **Escalation Flag:**  Indicate whether the findings require immediate attention from a human expert (e.g., due to high risk or uncertainty). The flag should specify the reason for escalation.
        *   This will output to a message bus or queue for consumption by the Orchestration Manager.

**Example Scenario and How Policies Apply**

Let's say the agent is tasked with generating a report on the security posture of a specific system.

1.  **Seed Evidence:**  The initial "seed" evidence might be the system's security configuration file, a recent vulnerability scan report, and the last penetration test report.  The `policy.seed.evidence_threshold` would ensure that these initial sources are highly reliable.

2.  **Evidence Gathering:** The agent gathers additional evidence, such as security logs, network traffic data, and threat intelligence feeds.  It uses the `policy.research_depth` to limit the number of external sources it queries (e.g., only consult reputable threat intelligence providers).

3.  **Analysis:**  The agent analyzes the evidence and identifies potential vulnerabilities.  It assigns a confidence score to each vulnerability based on the strength of the supporting evidence. The `policy.evidence_threshold` ensures that only vulnerabilities with a sufficiently high confidence score are included in the report.

4.  **Reporting:**  The agent generates a structured report containing a summary of the identified vulnerabilities, their confidence scores, and the supporting evidence identifiers. It also provides a next-step recommendation (e.g., "Patch the identified vulnerabilities") or an escalation flag (e.g., "Critical vulnerability requires immediate attention").  The entire process is governed by the `policy.latency_budget`.

**Key Improvements and Considerations**

*   **Clarity:**  More specific language and examples.
*   **Actionability:**  Explicit "Actions" linked to each objective and policy.
*   **Concrete Outputs:**  Detailed specification of the report format and content, including confidence scores and evidence identifiers.  The output JSON example provides a realistic view of what the agent produces.
*   **Error Handling:**  Consider how the agent should handle situations where it cannot meet the policy requirements (e.g., insufficient evidence, exceeding the latency budget).
*   **Monitoring and Logging:**  The agent should log all actions and decisions for auditing and debugging purposes.
*   **Iterative Refinement:**  This is a starting point.  You'll need to refine this further based on your specific use case and requirements.
*   **Integration:**  Clearly define how this agent interacts with other components in the system (e.g., data sources, orchestration engine, message queues).

By adding this level of detail, you can create a much more robust and well-defined specification for the "Structured Report Builder Primary" agent, which will help ensure that it performs its tasks accurately, efficiently, and in compliance with relevant policies and regulations.
