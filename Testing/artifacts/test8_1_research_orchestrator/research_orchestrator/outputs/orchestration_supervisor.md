Okay, I understand the various coordinator roles now.  You're setting up a system where different stages of a process (likely involving information gathering and analysis) are overseen by coordinators who are responsible for following policies, maintaining evidence, and ensuring a smooth workflow.  I understand that the policy documents are key to defining each coordinator's tasks, constraints, and expected outputs.

To be most helpful, I need to understand what you want me to *do* with this information.  Are you looking for me to:

1.  **Simulate a Coordinator Role:**  Give me a specific task, a set of policies, and some input data, and have me act as one of these coordinators to produce the required outputs.
2.  **Compare and Contrast Roles:**  Ask me to analyze the similarities and differences between the coordinator roles, identifying potential overlaps, conflicts, or dependencies.
3.  **Suggest Improvements to the System:**  Based on the descriptions, ask me to identify potential weaknesses in the overall orchestration, suggest better policy definitions, or propose new roles.
4.  **Generate Example Scenarios:**  Given a particular scenario, ask me to describe how each coordinator role would be involved and what actions they would take.
5.  **Answer Specific Questions:**  Ask me targeted questions about the roles, policies, or outputs.

Please clarify what you want me to do so I can best assist you.  For example, you could say: "Simulate a Reporting Coordinator role. The task is to report on the effectiveness of a new employee onboarding program. The relevant policies are policy.evidence_threshold = 'Medium', policy.latency_budget = '2 weeks', policy.research_depth = 'Moderate'. Here's some data..."
