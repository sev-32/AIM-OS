Okay, I understand. As the Literature Search Coordinator, operating within the "Search Coordination" stage of the Literature Search process, my primary focus is on ensuring that all literature search activities adhere to established policies and contribute to a well-governed and evidence-aligned outcome. My goal is to effectively manage the search process, synthesizing findings, assessing their confidence, and recommending the most appropriate next steps.

Here's a breakdown of my responsibilities based on the provided information:

**1. Adherence to Policies:**

*   **Evidence Alignment and Governance Compliance:**  This is paramount. I must ensure all search strategies and included sources are justifiable and comply with relevant regulations and internal guidelines.  This means maintaining meticulous records of search terms, databases used, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the rationale behind each decision.
*   **Orchestration Policies:** I will adhere to the predefined workflows and protocols established for this literature search.  This might involve using specific search tools, templates, or reporting mechanisms.
*   **Specific Policy Considerations:** I will be guided by the following policies:
    *   **`policy.evidence_threshold`:**  I need to understand the required level of evidence for inclusion. This dictates the rigor of my search and the type of evidence considered acceptable (e.g., peer-reviewed articles, grey literature, etc.).
    *   **`policy.latency_budget`:** I will prioritize efficiency and aim to complete my tasks within the allocated time frame. I'll need to proactively identify and mitigate potential delays.
    *   **`policy.research_depth`:**  This determines how comprehensive the search needs to be. Should I prioritize breadth (covering a wide range of sources) or depth (focusing on a specific set of high-impact studies)?
    *   **`policy.seed.evidence_threshold`:**  Specifically related to the initial "seed" studies.  What level of evidence is required for these seed studies to be considered valid starting points for the search?
    *   **`policy.seed.max_research_depth`:** Limits the depth of exploration starting from the seed studies.  Helps to avoid rabbit holes.
    *   **`policy.seed.max_total_time`:** Sets a time limit for investigating the seed studies and their related literature.
    *   **`policy.stage_alignment`:**  I must ensure that my work aligns with the overall goals and objectives of the Literature Search stage and contributes effectively to subsequent stages.

**2. Completing Assigned Actions:**

*   This involves performing the actual literature search based on the provided instructions and parameters. It includes formulating search strategies, executing searches in relevant databases and repositories, screening results, and extracting relevant information.

**3. Generating Required Outputs:**

*   **`Structured summary of findings`:**  This should be a concise and organized overview of the key findings from the literature search.  It might include:
    *   A description of the search strategy.
    *   The number of results found in each database.
    *   The number of articles screened and included/excluded.
    *   A summary of the key themes and insights emerging from the literature.
    *   Tables or figures summarizing relevant data.

*   **`Confidence score with supporting evidence identifiers`:**  This is crucial for assessing the reliability and validity of the findings. The confidence score should be based on:
    *   The quality of the included studies (e.g., study design, sample size, methodological rigor).
    *   The consistency of the findings across different studies.
    *   The presence of any biases or limitations.
    *   Explicitly linking the confidence score to the specific sources (evidence identifiers) that support the assessment. This will require clear documentation of the rationale behind the confidence score. For example, "Confidence: High (90%) - Supported by three meta-analyses [ID: Meta1, Meta2, Meta3] and five randomized controlled trials [ID: RCT1, RCT2, RCT3, RCT4, RCT5] with consistent findings and low risk of bias."

*   **`Next-step recommendation or escalation flag`:**  Based on the findings and the confidence score, I will recommend the most appropriate next steps:
    *   **Next-Step Recommendation:**  This might include:
        *   Moving to the next stage of the project (e.g., data extraction, synthesis).
        *   Refining the search strategy to address any gaps in the literature.
        *   Seeking expert input on specific aspects of the findings.
        *   Suggesting alternative research directions.
    *   **Escalation Flag:**  I will raise an escalation flag if:
        *   The literature is inconclusive or contradictory.
        *   The evidence is weak or unreliable.
        *   The search has revealed potential ethical or regulatory issues.
        *   The search is exceeding the latency budget or research depth limits.
        *   Clarification or deviation from specified policies is needed.

**In summary, my role is to conduct a policy-compliant and efficient literature search, synthesize the findings, assess their confidence, and provide clear recommendations to guide the project forward.  I will be diligent in documenting my process and ensuring that my work aligns with the overarching objectives of the literature search.**

Before I begin, I need clarification on:

1.  **The specific databases and search tools to be used.**
2.  **The specific inclusion/exclusion criteria for the literature search.**
3.  **The preferred format for the structured summary of findings.**
4.  **The method for assigning and documenting evidence identifiers.**
5.  **The scale and criteria for the confidence score.**

Once I have this information, I can start the literature search.
