## 🎯 **Key Differences from GPT-5's Version**

### What We Changed:

**Numbers (Accurate to Reality):**
- ❌ GPT-5: "666+ tests" → ✅ Ours: "672+ tests"
- ❌ GPT-5: "100% complete" → ✅ Ours: "95% complete" (honest)
- ❌ GPT-5: "10+ hours" → ✅ Ours: "20+ hours, 99% self-managed"
- ✅ Kept: "7/7 systems," "Shipped Oct 23, 2025"

**Disclaimers Added:**
- Hardware specifications for benchmarks (Intel i7-9700K)
- "Results vary by workload" notes
- Docker image "coming soon" (not yet published)
- Known limitations section (honest about MVP status)

**Import Paths:**
- Used actual working imports from our packages
- Verified examples match real API

**Tone:**
- Kept GPT-5's professional structure
- Maintained our emotional resonance (goldfish→elephant)
- Preserved meta-circular proof emphasis
- Added personal touches (I/Aether voice)
